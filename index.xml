      <description> Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Mason. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working as an embedded systems engineer at Ayar Labs.
I made this website to write about personal projects and thoughts. Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn or social media if you have any comments or questions. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually use the email linked on the front page; I just wanted to see if it would get scraped and spammed.

      <description>Intro Towards the end of 2018, I took a larger interest in films, largely thanks to a few friends who showed me the amount of thought, planning, and technology that goes into crafting a good movie. I figured I might as well document my viewing history.
Ratings are mostly based on personal enjoyment, but directing, creativity, and technical aspects are also factored in. My average film rating as of June 25 is 7.</description>

      <description>Inspiration I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to make a website for a while. In college, the thought process was to create a digital portfolio to showcase my worth. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve graduated and have some time to kill before starting work, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly just a fun project for self-improvement purposes. I figured that I could document all of my hobby projects and share some of my thoughts online rather than letting everything sit on my hard drive, for my eyes only.</description>
