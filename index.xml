      <description>Intro During the summer of 2020, I stumbled upon the mechanical keyboard hobby. I had heard about it before, but wrote it off as a waste of money. Who&amp;rsquo;d spend 150 bucks on some plastic keycaps?
I guess having an engineering income changes you - I&amp;rsquo;d end up spending a few thousand in total on all my keyboard purchases.
From the very beginning, the keyboard I had my eyes on was the Satisfaction75.</description>

      <description>Intro Nothing new to say once again, just more content that I&amp;rsquo;ve consumed. REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.
Ratings Matrix 2: 7 / 10 I liked Matrix 2 even more than the first Matrix. With the scene already set, we get to dive even deeper into the Matrix, following fully unleased Neo and Agent Smith, among other charismatic characters (I love the Keymaker). Matrix 2 features even better production quality, hype extended fights, and a layered story with a lot of moving parts.</description>

      <description>Intro For the longest time, I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to get into art. Every once in a while, I&amp;rsquo;d see amazing concept art online and get a brief burst of inspiration. I&amp;rsquo;d think to myself, &amp;ldquo;Damn, I wanna make something like that. But then I&amp;rsquo;d think about all the time and effort necessary to get to a professional level, and I&amp;rsquo;d give up before starting.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what changed, but at the end of last year (late December 2021), I finally found the motivation to get started.</description>

Ratings Avatar: The Last Airbender: 8 / 10 Book 1: 6 / 10 I was bored, browsed Netflix, saw this, figured I&amp;rsquo;d see what all the hype was about. I&amp;rsquo;d say this first arc was mostly just setup. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, the characters, world-building, and general atmosphere are great. But nothing much of substance happens barring the first few and last few episodes.</description>

      <description>Intro I&amp;rsquo;m mixing things up this year. Instead of purely spoiler-free movie ratings, this year we&amp;rsquo;re rating everything entertainment. Movies, TV shows, books, anime, and video games. Write-ups will be much more free-form and likely full of spoilers. In the end, this list is moreso for me than anyone else, so read at your own risk I guess. REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.
Ratings The Tatami Galaxy: 6 / 10 Oh boy, first review of the year.</description>

      <description>This morning, I woke up at 4:30 to drop my family off at the airport. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much sleep last night - I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really tired until 11, and then I stayed up for another hour when the Kawhi/PG news broke. It was a 45 minute drive to the airport and too early for anyone to feel like talking much. Spent some time hugging everyone and saying goodbye, and that was it.</description>

      <description>Intro Towards the end of 2018, I took a larger interest in films, largely thanks to a few friends who showed me the amount of thought and creativity that goes into a good movie. I figured I might as well document what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. Average movie rating for 2019 came out to 6.85. Makes sense. Watched a lot great stuff this year.
Ratings are accompanied by a few paragraphs of my thoughts and are spoiler free, except for drop-down sections labelled as such.</description>

      <description>Inspiration I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to make a website for a while. In college, the thought process was to create a digital portfolio to showcase my worth. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve graduated and have some time to kill before starting work, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly just a fun project for self-improvement purposes and to practice writing. I figured I could document all of my hobby projects and share some of my thoughts online rather than letting everything sit on a hard drive, for my eyes only.</description>
