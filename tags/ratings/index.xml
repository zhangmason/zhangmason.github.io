      <description>Intro Towards the end of 2018, I took a larger interest in films, largely thanks to a few friends who showed me the amount of thought, planning, and technology that goes into crafting a good movie. I figured I might as well document what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. My average rating as of June 25 is 7.13. I think that&amp;rsquo;s reasonable, since I generally choose to watch good movies.
Ratings are accompanied by a few paragraphs of my thoughts and are spoiler free, except for drop-down sections labelled as such.</description>
