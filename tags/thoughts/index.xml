      <description>This morning, I woke up at 4:30 to drop my family off at the airport. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much sleep last night - I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really tired until 11, and then I stayed up for another hour when the Kawhi/PG news broke. It was a 45 minute drive to the airport and too early for anyone to feel like talking much. Spent some time hugging everyone and saying goodbye, and that was it.</description>

      <description>Intro Towards the end of 2018, I took a larger interest in films, largely thanks to a few friends who showed me the amount of thought and creativity that goes into a good movie. I figured I might as well document what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. Average movie rating for 2019 came out to 6.85. Makes sense. Watched a lot great stuff this year.
Ratings are accompanied by a few paragraphs of my thoughts and are spoiler free, except for drop-down sections labelled as such.</description>
