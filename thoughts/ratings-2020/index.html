<h3 id="the-tatami-galaxy-tatami-6-10"><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei" target="_blank">The Tatami Galaxy</a>: 6 / 10</h3>

<p>Oh boy, first review of the year. The Tatami Galaxy is a somewhat obscure but critically arthouse anime (I&rsquo;ll call it a film) that I&rsquo;ve had on my watch list for some time. Its one of those films that doesn&rsquo;t really care about plot or character development; rather, its all about unconventional storytelling and executing that in a beautiful way. In that respect, this film is a resounding success. As I approached the final episodes, I really had to sit back and appreciate how well all the puzzle pieces fit together. If I tried to elaborate why, I wouldn&rsquo;t do the show justice, so <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=263117" target="_blank">here&rsquo;s a great analysis I found online</a>.</p>

<p>I love stylistic animation that makes full use of the medium rather than just mimicing reality (physical character transformations). And I love symbol-heavy shows that reward you for paying attention to small details (e.g. each reality having a different non-rose color) and reoccuring motifs (the moth, representing the anti-butterfly effect). But this show left me disappointed at the end. I knew from the very beginning that Watashi just needed to appreciate what he had (and go for Akashi) rather than dream of a a rose-colored campus life. After a few repetitions, I was a bit frustrated and just waiting for something to happen.</p>

<p>And honestly, I care a lot about characters and plot. All of the characters were moreso symbols rather than fleshed out characters (although I really liked how Ozu was depicted), so I didn&rsquo;t have anyone to latch onto. And again, there wasn&rsquo;t much of a plot to follow.
The individual subplots probably had some substance to them (e.g. the bee cult), but it was all so abstract, weird, and fast-paced that I couldn&rsquo;t really appreciate any message that was being said. This show was story for the sake of meaning. Not story intertwined with meaning.</p>

<p>Music was overall fitting and decent. Animation quality could&rsquo;ve been better (abstract animation does not give a pass for low budget). A lot of stuff went over my head (what was the point of Kaori? Why was Higuchi reading 20k Leagues Under The Sea?). Overall, I agree with the central message, but I feel like it would&rsquo;ve been more fitting if Watashi missed his opportunity with Akashi and just lived with that (rather than getting a million chances to realize the &ldquo;right choice&rdquo;).</p>

<p>So yeah. Well executed and artistic, but not my cup of tea.</p>

<h3 id="the-witcher-witcher-5-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5180504/" target="_blank">The Witcher</a>: 5 / 10</h3>

<p>Just gonna put it out there that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J12piNzOVuI" target="_blank">Episode 1 fight scene</a> in the village was BEAUTIFUL.</p>

<p>This was blowing up online, it got a lot of hype online, and I played through Witcher 3, so why not. Cinematography and worldbuilding were 10 / 10. Beautiful scenery and immaculate CGI. However, the story-telling was extremely disjointed. I played through the third game and watched a 15 minute explanatory video beforehand, and I was still a little confused. There&rsquo;s zero indication until about halfway through the series that people are being shown in different time periods. You wouldn&rsquo;t know about the time skips unless you watched an explanatory video.</p>

<p>Geralt was cast perfectly. Yennefer on the other hand was very unlikable. Yes, we get it, you want a baby. You knew exactly what the consequences were for transformation, so get over it. Dara MVP.</p>

<h3 id="persona-5-p5-9-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_5" target="_blank">Persona 5</a>: 9 / 10</h3>

<p>Let me just start off by saying that this game has my favorite soundtrack ever, spanning movies, shows, and games. I created a Persona 5 playlist that I listen to while working. The music was stylish, but so was the rest of the game. Zero corners were cut - the music, art, combat, and transitions all meshed together perfectly. Finishing off an enemy with a seamlessly animated all-out-attack always felt satisfying, even after hundreds (thousands?) of battles. For what the creators were trying to accomplish, with the game engine that they had, it was done perfectly. I also have to commend the immense amount of detail put into the game. Accurate depictions of Tokyo, pages upon pages of dialogue, hundreds of persona descriptions and mechanics, etc.</p>

<p>The game really drew me in at the beginning. The sheer amount of places to explore, people to meet, and time to efficiently allocate made the game  extremely immersive. Story got a bit repetive towards the end, however, and the Holy Grail plot at the end just felt completely contrived. Not sure what they would&rsquo;ve done with Morgana, but I would&rsquo;ve been happy with Shido as the final boss.</p>

<p>The first few characters (Ann, Ryuji, Morgana, Yusuke, and Makoto) were awesome. Hanging out and interacting with them in game felt natural, like hanging out with an actual person. Towards the middle/end of the game, new side characters/enemies started feeling pretty cookie cutter though. There just wasn&rsquo;t enough time left in the game to flesh out characters like Haru or Shinya.</p>

<p>Combat was fun and never got too boring. Even on hard mode, the game wasn&rsquo;t hard at all (other than Okumura - I spent 3 hours fighting him), but that&rsquo;s okay. I played the game not for a challenge, but to hang out with my friends and enjoy the character dynamics. Great game.</p>

<h3 id="breaking-bad-season-2-brba2-8-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/episodes?season=2" target="_blank">Breaking Bad Season 2</a>: 8 / 10</h3>

<p>Breaking Bad continues to impress. While Season 1 drew me in because of the brilliant premise, Season 2&rsquo;s allure was the tension. The constant question of &ldquo;How the hell will they get out of this one?&rdquo; Okay, I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of the 2 episodes where Jesse and Walt got stranded in the desert. That felt contrived. But everything else was great. The terrifying interactions with Tuco (RIP), the tension as the mute Mexican rang his bell in the police station, the anxiety-inducing interactions between Walt and Skyler.</p>

<p>The acting was superb. Especially from Jesse. The episode where Jesse breaks into the druggie house and interacts with a neglected child was so bitter and heartwarming. At this point, I think Jesse&rsquo;s my favorite character. A bad guy that&rsquo;s good on the inside. In contrast with Walt - the good guy turning bad. The more I like Jesse, the more I also hate Walter White. He&rsquo;s an asshole, liar, and has double standards. Yeah yeah, he cares about Jesse to a certain extent with the &ldquo;no money until clean&rdquo; thing, and he&rsquo;s doing it for his family (is he really?), and life dealt him a bad hand. But what can I say. He killed Jane. And it hurts to watch a character treat others like shit for no reason. It&rsquo;s like Whiplash: a phenomenal movie, but so painful to watch.</p>

<p>That being said, I&rsquo;m glad Walt has to face the consequences of his actions. He gets what he deserves when Skyler tells him to leave. Not a fan of the airplane crash at the end though. I don&rsquo;t like the aspect of fate that&rsquo;s brought into a show that&rsquo;s otherwise gritty and realistic (as far as dramas go). And the teddy bear intro was a huge bait. I&rsquo;m sure most people were disappointed by the random payoff to that foreshadowing.</p>

<p>Looking forward to Season 3. I hear that Breaking Bad keeps getting better, and with things getting set up with the cartels, I can only imagine.</p>

<h3 id="ping-pong-the-animation-pingpong-9-10"><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/22135/Ping_Pong_the_Animation" target="_blank">Ping Pong the Animation</a>: 9 / 10</h3>

<p>I thought Ping Pong the Animation was very average when I watched it freshman year, but given my recent appreciation for film and anime, I figured I&rsquo;d give it another chance.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I did, because even though the style objectively looks shitty, it has a certain twisted charm to it. Otherwise, Ping Pong was entertaining, touching, and a perfect representation of competitive sports&rsquo; multiple facets. So what it lacks in terms of aesthetics/budget is made up for with plain &lsquo;ol good storytelling.</p>

<p>I loved the character symbols/motifs in this show. The opposite but intertwined moon and star. The robot and the hero. &ldquo;Blood is Iron.&rdquo; I saw character representations that were wholly realistic and relatable, yet never really portrayed in entertainment. Someone who works harder than anyone else should have some form of success right? Nope - Sakuma&rsquo;s dreams crushed. What if you have talent and work hard? Well, you might still lose, and fail to accomplish your dream (Kong).  Ping Pong really nails home that for someone to win, someone else has to lose. And some people just don&rsquo;t have the right motivation, talent, or upbringing to succeed, no matter how much they sacrifice.</p>

<p>But Ping Pong also touches on the other side of competition - how fun it is to win and to compete at the top level. The higher you fly and the better you get, the more beautiful the game becomes. You get to see sights that no one below you could even imagine. Ping Pong is less-so a show about table tennis and moreso a reflection on the nature of competition and what motivates people. It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>

<p>The show was only 12 episodes, but it had more content and character development than most shows twice as long. While most characters were essentially one-dimensional symbols, they were given enough personality for me to be invested. That includes the two main characters, Tsukimoto and Peco. But I don&rsquo;t know. Their relationship was just so poetic. The hero&rsquo;s fall and rise to defeat the robot and save the day, no matter what; it brought a Smile to my face.</p>

<h3 id="weathering-with-you-weathering-7-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9426210/" target="_blank">Weathering With You</a>: 7 / 10</h3>

<p>A thought experiment that I like to ask people is would you rather sacrifice your family or the everyone living in Vietnam? Nothing against Vietnam - I arbitrarily chose that country and it stuck. Surprisingly, the answers have been approximately <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub>. Personally, I&rsquo;ve always been in the camp where I&rsquo;d just sacrifice my family for the greater good of 96 million people. But after watching Weathering With You, I realized I&rsquo;d do the same thing as Hodaka. Eh. Screw Tokyo, go for the girl.</p>

<p>Anyway, I bought tickets to see this in theaters because I loved Kimi no Na wa so much. As expected, the animation was impeccable. I loved how vibrant the colors were in the sunny parts of the film, and was again impressed by Shinkai&rsquo;s ability to create scenes that are both hyper-realistic and beautifully surreal. I don&rsquo;t want to sound like a broken record, so I won&rsquo;t elaborate any more on the animation. But it&rsquo;s definitely a 10 / 10.</p>

<p>Characters were also very likable. I loved Natsumi&rsquo;s banter and dynamic with Hodaka. CEO had a nice (albeit forced) sub-plot, and little brother is a straight baller. Finally, Hodaka and Hina are very cookie cutter Shinkai characters. But who doesn&rsquo;t like cookies?</p>

<p>Not everything is rainbows and sunshine though. I think the film suffered from the fact that it came after Kimi no Na wa. It just wasn&rsquo;t as novel, especially since a lot of story elements felt rehashed. For example, when Hodaka was running on the train tracks and repeating Hina&rsquo;s name, it just didn&rsquo;t have much impact. All I could think was &ldquo;This is Mitsuha running and calling out for Taki.&rdquo; I think the movie was destined to be overshadowed by its predecessor. Copy too much from Kimi no Na wa, and it&rsquo;s a clone. Deviate too much and you lose the formula that drew everyone in in the first place.</p>

<p>Subversion of expectations and/or novelty is pretty important in making something memorable. That was the case for Kimi no Na wa: one of my friends summarized it super well, so read <a href="https://medium.com/dango-ramen/on-kimi-no-na-wa-80f3cbf04ea1" target="_blank">her review</a>.</p>

<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the case this time. I appreciate how the film depicts the struggle to earn money/find jobs/support family in a refreshing and modern way. But the strongest takeaway message was that Big Macs taste good. The plot was laid out from the very beginning by the fortune teller and museum guide, and there were almost no surprises (Alright, I didn&rsquo;t expect Tokyo to just get perma-flooded at the end) other than contrived developments to accelerate the plot (that final gun scene in the abandoned building&hellip;). Characters didn&rsquo;t really develop much either, so in the end, it&rsquo;s one of those films that&rsquo;s really entertaining in the moment, but somewhat forgetable afterwards. But yeah, overall I liked it.</p>

<h3 id="marriage-story-marriage-5-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7653254/" target="_blank">Marriage Story</a>: 5 / 10</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d say it was pretty good overall. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver played two very endearing and realistic characters. Although at times it felt a bit too realistic, if that makes any sense&hellip; Like they weren&rsquo;t boring enough to ACTUALLY be real people, but they were realistic in the realm of movie characters. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t have too much to say about the movie. It was sort of like Whiplash: great characters, but hard to watch. It was clear throughout the movie that Scarlett and Adam were decent human beings that still loved each other, but things just couldn&rsquo;t work out. And I guess that&rsquo;s why the whole divorce process felt so agonizing. I have no idea how realistic all the legal stuff is, but god damn.</p>

<p>Off-topic, but I read this funny comment on Reddit: &ldquo;Adam Driver looks like someone tried to draw Keanu Reeves from memory.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="shiki-shiki-6-10"><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/7724/Shiki" target="_blank">Shiki</a>: 6 / 10</h3>

<p>So after watching some trash that doesn&rsquo;t deserve to get on here, I grudgingly agreed to watch Shiki with my roommate. I was pleasantly surprised. A horror/thriller type show where the characters ACTUALLY make rational and sensible decisions. Its astonishing that a cohesive plot and non-braindead characters is abnormal.</p>

<p>I found most of the characters generally pretty likable (even the really annoying dude with the weird face). I think the doctor is one of my favorite characters of all time. Caring and smart but also a ruthless, methodical killer. I guess it sounds pretty sick to say this, but I was glad to see him experiment on his wife. Not from the POV of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sadistic,&rdquo; but from the POV that he was doing what he needed to in order to understand the vampires (despite the immorality of torture). Apparently, I&rsquo;m the only person who supported this action out of the other friends that my roommate watched Shiki with. On the other hand, I absolutely hated the priest character. I found his philosophy of &ldquo;nobody has to die&rdquo; to be naive and hypocritical. I mean, come on. One of the last scenes of the show was him killing the shopkeeper. And while I agree that it&rsquo;s not the vampires&rsquo; fault for instinctively murdering people, there&rsquo;s a double standard that he&rsquo;s holding humans to. Why is it wrong for humans to kill vampires as a means of self-defense? What should the humans do, just keel over and slowly die off?</p>

<p>Wasn&rsquo;t a fan of the animation style (especially all those weird, static hairstyles), but the animation quality was decent. Music was alright. I really like the moral ambiguity of the show. Even though &ldquo;vampires are people too!&rdquo; has been done before (think Blade Runner), Shiki did an excellent job of highlighting multiple facets of this concept by following dozens of different character arcs. Overall, enthralling storytelling with (I cannot emphasize this enough) characters that make rational decisions. Shit. I need to reconsider what I&rsquo;m watching if that&rsquo;s a highlight of this show.  Anyway, a fitting anime to watch given current events (coronavirus).</p>

<h3 id="promare-promare-9-10"><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35848/Promare" target="_blank">Promare</a>: 9 / 10</h3>

<p>I love Studio Trigger. Kill la Kill is my 2nd favorite anime, and Gurren Lagann is top 10. Everything&rsquo;s so over the top and ridiculous, that I feel perfectly fine turning my brain off, ignoring the flaws, and enjoying the ride. Let me get some objective negatives out of the way (because I don&rsquo;t really care): the characters were bland. There&rsquo;s blatant plagiarism of Gurren Lagann and Kill La Kill (I mean come on - Kamina? giant drills? Exact same voice actors?). One might call the multitude of plot twists contrived. All that on top of of questionable premise.</p>

<p>But really, the movie was so awesome and fun that I forgive all that. First and foremost, JESUS that animation was gorgeous. Like, Spiderverse-level gorgeous. I&rsquo;m a sucker for stylistic animation, and Promare definitely gets a 10 / 10 in that regard. The crazy camera angles, flashy explosions, and hype music only added to the best audiovisual experience I&rsquo;ve had in a long time. The entire movie was just one big adrenaline rush, from start to finish. Probably 10 minutes of down-time in the entire movie. I was smiling almost the entire time. It takes a very special kind of movie to put a stupid grin on my face for almost 2 hours.</p>

<p>Comedy hit the spot for me as well. When main character baits a kiss with Aina, and later CPRs Lio, the entire room just started dying from laughter. I also really appreciated the researcher&rsquo;s mecha being named &ldquo;Deus X Machina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But yeah. Promare is full of passion. Both the characters and the production. Not much intellect, but a whole lot of passion. And explosions. Heck yeah. I think <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=312407" target="_blank">this review captures my feelings</a>.</p>

<h3 id="k-on-season-1-kon-8-10"><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On" target="_blank">K-On Season 1</a>: 8 / 10</h3>

<p>I love K-on. It&rsquo;s the OG - Yuru Camp before Yuru Camp.  Cute girls doing cute things, and the cute things happen to be playing rock music. That&rsquo;s a recipe for success in my book. I love the soundtrack, the characters, and the general turn-your-brain-off humor/group dynamics. Animation is also very consistent, which is a plus. In terms of negatives, it&rsquo;s a bit less lighthearted than Yuru Camp (wow, there&rsquo;s actually minor character conflicts!), which could be seen as a plus, but not for me. I just want to turn my brain off and watch happy people have fun together. Also not a fan of some of the anime tropes that clearly cater towards the stereotypical anime fan, and prevent me from recommending the series to just about anyone.</p>

<p>But seriously, I love the music. the upbeat rock/pop punk style featuring female vocals is amazing, and it&rsquo;s something I haven&rsquo;t been able to really find with &ldquo;real bands.&rdquo; Everything I like is there - the epic guitar solos, the prominent bassline, and the consistent yet varied drumline. Let me say, watching episode 12 was a real treat. Mio singing &ldquo;Fude Pen&rdquo; (which I&rsquo;d legitimately put up there with The Strokes in terms of favorite music) while Yui had her Episode 1 flashback montage, followed by the final &ldquo;Fuwa Fuwa Time&rdquo; performance, then a bittersweet pause and a final encore. Perfection.</p>

<p>Gritty Zootopia has a great premise with tons of potential to explore interesting themes related to racism, ambition, and love. So I was drawn in after watching a few episodes. Interesting character dynamics, tension right off the bat, and animation style that worked surprisingly well. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. The plot was erratic, contrived at times. Interesting themes were barely fleshed out, and instead we were given episode after episode of cringe-inducing self-loathing and melodrama. The series ended with what essentially boils down to &ldquo;Surprise! It&rsquo;s the Yakuza,&rdquo; followed by a completely contrived 2v35 in which the complete loser of a main character somehow defeats gun-wielding gang members to save his girl. Would not recommend.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe my mom watched this. No surprise at all that she walked out of the theater halfway through. I&rsquo;ve never seen this level of debauchery. EVER. But let me say&hellip; the casual drug abuse, lack of principles, and disgustingly excessive behavior was mesmerizing. It was a slow-motion train wreck where I knew things were gonna go to shit from the very start (never mess with the FBI). But the movie was crafted in such a spectacular way that the suspense lied in HOW it would all happen, rather than WHAT would happen.</p>

<p>Absolutely phenomenal moving. Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio are truly masters of their craft. I can&rsquo;t even begin to list the number of amazing moments throughout the movie. One scene that stood out was Jordan trying to get home from the country club near the end. I&rsquo;m shocked that Leonardo didn&rsquo;t win an Oscar. It was so pathetic yet enthralling watching him crawl to his car. Like, I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking &ldquo;shit, is he actually on drugs? How can he act this well?&rdquo; And the production on that particular scene was amazing as well. The distorted birds-eye view of the stairs before Jordan tumbled down it, the slow pan to the car, the internal monologue, the false narration with &ldquo;driving home, not a scratch on my car,&rdquo; man - there&rsquo;s so many aspects I want to commend, but can&rsquo;t properly put into words. There were so many amazing directorial choices that enhanced the storytelling. I swear, there was so much right with this movie, that I keep repeating how astounding it was.</p>

<p>A few random moments that I loved:</p>

<ul>
<li>Matthew Mcconaughey&rsquo;s explanation to Jordan on how to &ldquo;succeed&rdquo; on Wall Street</li>
<li>The moment of hesitation before Jordan saved Donnie, where we all thought, for a split second, that he was going to let Donnie die. Later followed by Jordan trying to prevent Donnie from incriminating himself.</li>
<li>The internal monologues, especially when Jordan was hanging out with his aunt-in-law in England</li>
<li>The slow ceiling dolly shot in and out of office floor was a really cool effect.</li>
<li>The camera following Jordan as he marched to his couch, then staying still while he ripped up his couch for his drug stash, feathers flying everywhere.</li>
<li>Wondering what was happening with the candle wax close-up, followed by the zoom-out to BDSM</li>
<li>The Mrs. Robinson montage at the end (plus real Jordan Belfort cameo)</li>
<li>Every single one of Jordan&rsquo;s speeches</li>

<p>Season 3 was alright. It had some exciting moments, but overall didn&rsquo;t feel very interesting compared to Season 2. I dunno. Just seems like not much happened, and the plot progression was a lot of what we&rsquo;ve seen before. The two Mexican cousins weren&rsquo;t all that intimidating compared to Tuco, Jesse was basically just depressed the entire season, and Walter continues to be a person I dislike.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sort of ironic that a movie about magic, just didn&rsquo;t have that Pixar magic for me. Yes, the animation and imagination was beautiful, as expected of Pixar. But I don&rsquo;t know, the movie just didn&rsquo;t really click. I feel like the premise was sort of a dud. I was never fully immersed in the movie because of its awkward half-mythical/magical and half-normal state. The &ldquo;epic quest&rdquo; felt pretty rushed and wasn&rsquo;t all that epic. The two main characters weren&rsquo;t especially endearing, and the whole pair of pants thing felt sort of tacked on, and not really crucial to the story, despite it being a central part of the story. I also felt like a lot of the &ldquo;touching moments&rdquo; came about in a somewhat unnatural (do I say it? &hellip; contrived) way. Like when the two brothers instantly stopped quarreling once Pants-Dad started dancing, and how Barley brought up his 4th memory of not saying goodbye to his dad near the end of the movie to setup for the finale. There were just too many side characters with not enough screen-time and too many threads for it to fit together seamlessly.</p>

<p>K-on Season 2 was basically a continuation of Season 1. For the most part I grew more and more attached to the characters and of course their music. Seriously, I loved the music. Season 2 had so many bangers. Both endings, Pure Pure Heart, U&amp;I, and of course the Episode 24 farewell song. My biggest gripe with the series was that there wasn&rsquo;t enough music. Yeah yeah, the whole point is that they always mess around and never practice, but the music is what pushes K-on from pretty good to great in my eyes. Not gonna lie, I was a little frustrated that half of the Episode 20 concert was Yui rambling on and on, and only about 6 minutes of jams. Not sure if we ever got a full rendition of Fuwa Fuwa this second season.</p>

<p>One theme that we had looming over us this season was graduation. And K-on really nailed that familiar bittersweet feeling of &ldquo;shit, it&rsquo;s really almost over&rdquo;. The final episode made me cry for the first time watching something. It really was beautifully done.</p>

<p>Haruhi definitely had an interesting premise and some nifty characters. But at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s a substance-lacking slice-of-life with limited plot or character development. Overall, it was enjoyable enough to watch. But there weren&rsquo;t any characters that really spoke to me, and that&rsquo;s necessary for a show that&rsquo;s not driven by its plot. Yes, Haruhi had a very explosive personality, but she was sort of a prick. That being said, the production quality was great, even by today&rsquo;s standards. I also respect the audacity of creating the Endless Eight, and I thought the movie was excellent (elevating the series as a whole).</p>

<p>Roommate and I binged Hunter X Hunter in a week. So on average 20 episodes a day. Obviously, we loved it. For me, a great show show has great characters, and HxH has plenty of those. In particular, Kurapika is a hilariously edgy badass, Hisoka is a hilariously compelling villain (I mean come on - he&rsquo;s an overpowered pedophilic clown - how funny is that?), and Netero is just plain insane. All the side-Hunters during Chimera Ant were really well-designed, as were the members of the Phantom Troupe. And then there&rsquo;s Killua. Baaaaaka. Nonchalant, mischievious, and the best friend anyone could ask for. One of my favorite characters of all time. I often found myself frustrated with Gon&rsquo;s stupidity. Thankfully Killua was usually there to save the day.</p>

<p>The show started off somewhat slow, and a lot of episodes were devoted to training in general. But that&rsquo;s a necessary evil - it made Gon and Killua&rsquo;s power ups more believable, to the point where they&rsquo;re insanely strong, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem contrived. Phantom Troupe arc was a masterpiece. Non-stop action, cool fights, characters using their brains (shocking right?), and just plain good storytelling. Did I mention that Kurapika is a badass? Greed Island was entertaining enough, but nothing special. The Bomber as the antagonist was so forgetable, that I vividly remember how forgetable he was. Chimera Ant arc wasn&rsquo;t my cup of tea. It was extremely slow-paced, and fell sin to one of my biggest peeves: overuse of narration. At the beginning of the palace invasion, I was ready for some real hype. Instead, we got 3 minutes stretched into 7 episodes with constant slo-mo, re-use of shots, and that damn narrator explaining the situation every 2 minutes. Show, don&rsquo;t tell. Please. Go away narrator.</p>

<p>But yeah. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll see another shounen executed this well. A fun ride.</p>

<p>Honestly, I wasn&rsquo;t too impressed by 1917. It did an excellent job executing its (double) single-take gimmick, and the set and costume design was spot-on. But, the movie just wasn&rsquo;t that entertaining. It was sort of like a Cohen Brother film. Realistic to the point of boredom. After Blake died 30 minutes into the movie, I thought to myself &ldquo;Well I guess William has plot armor now.&rdquo; So the rest of the movie was just a walking simulator (with a bit of running). A visually-stunning technical achievement. But a boring one.</p>

<p>Played through Ending A of Nier, and there&rsquo;s still a lot of content to play through, so hopefully I can pick it up again, because its a great game, albeit repetitive. I&rsquo;m a sucker for production value, and Nier definitely has it all. When I first stepped into the desert, I just thought &ldquo;holy shit, this place is massive.&rdquo; And there&rsquo;s so many little nooks and crannies that you&rsquo;re rewarded for investigating. Shoutouts to the stick that I spent half an hour parkouring to get. Also shoutouts to a great soundtrack, and weapon combos that just feel soooooo good. That spear charge attack is so satisfying.</p>

<p>The whole Adam and Eve thing was pretty dumb (and cringe-inducing at times) but apart from that, I really like the whole robot apocalypse thing they got going on. It&rsquo;s inherently a great premise, and that&rsquo;s aided by some awesome storytelling. There&rsquo;s an invasion happening halfway through, and not only are there swarms of robots, but the entire abandoned city gets terraformed. Wow. I also liked the little 5 minute Route B intro, where you act as a robot trying to get oil for your brother.</p>

<p>One thing I dislike is the over-sexuality of 2B. It doesn&rsquo;t add anything to the game, so all it really does is make this a game I hesitate to recommend to, say, my sister.</p>

<p>Update post-ending B: Man, kill me now. That was a chore to finish. Not a fan of the hacking mini-game in general, and I really had to replay the same game for 10 hours&hellip;</p>

<p>Update post-ending C: Sorta bored with the game by now. Disliking 9S as a character doesn&rsquo;t really help.</p>

<p>After half a year of watching Breaking Bad on and off, it&rsquo;s over. The Season&rsquo;s over. Everyone&rsquo;s dead. Even so, I gotta say. He. Can&rsquo;t. Keep. Getting. Away. With. It.</p>

<p>Season 5 was amazing. After Gus died, I sort of thought to myself, &ldquo;Okay the main antagonist is dead. What now?&rdquo; Turns out, I forgot that Walt was the main antagonist. Holy shit. He&rsquo;s a bad bad man. Jesse, that poor poor soul. I&rsquo;m actually so impressed with Breaking Bad. Almost all of my favorite movies/shows feature characters that I love. Other than Jesse, I despised almost every main character in this show. Skyler was (deservedly) depressed. Hank was a bad cop. Marie was sorta dumb. Lydia was annoying. And Neo-Nazis are Neo-Nazis. Oh yeah, and of course, there&rsquo;s Walt. He&rsquo;s a bad bad man. I do really like what they did with him at the end. He just stopped giving a fucked and killed everyone, while finally admitting &ldquo;All of this, I did for me.&rdquo; The catharsis, ohhh my god. He said it. &ldquo;Jesse, do it for me.&rdquo; Oh yeah. And then that ending scene, with the Baby Blue song playing? Perfection.</p>

<p>One aspect I really liked about Breaking Bad, and especially this last season was all the artsy shots the had. Not for any particular purpose but to look cool. You know, water coming out of a faucet transitioning into some chemicals being poured into a vat. Walter trying to get his family to pack, and that shot of a phone and a knife, then Skyler reaching for the knife. Skyler on the phone with Marie, then the camera moves, and there&rsquo;s walt behind the beam. And the acting. Walt calmly walking around Elliot&rsquo;s house. Jesse&rsquo;s suffering. Saul trolling, of course.</p>

<p>Honestly, I could go on and on, but I have nothing for praise for Breaking Bad Season 5. What a wild ride.</p>

<p>Chernobyl was a treat. I did not expect that level of production value. I saw a picture of the Chernobyl wreckage after watching it and was blown away to see a picture that looked exactly like the reactor building in the show. I also thought the show was eye-opening to how stupid people can be in real life. If it wasn&rsquo;t mostly true to actual events, I would&rsquo;ve cried out &ldquo;contrived! This is so contrived!&rdquo; very quickly. &ldquo;How are these people so dumb? This is so contrived&hellip;&rdquo; Jesus Christ. The reality denial throughout episodes 1 and 2.</p>

<p>A few things I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of (since its repetitive to always sing praise for acting, production value, etc):
* Even though Khomyuk was a fictional character and a plot device, I hated her. Telling Legasov that he has to sacrifice himself to tell the world the truth&hellip; like come on. Just do it yourself. Your reasoning that &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll listen to you and only to you&rdquo; is bullshit. Smh.
* I thought the story arcs of the teenager shooting dogs and the pregnant woman were irrelevant, and a waste of time. Yeah I get it. This affects every day people.</p>

<p>I really liked Ex Machina. But I also feel like it doesn&rsquo;t have the masterpiece feel to it. As a complete film novice, there were a lot of scenes where I stopped and thought &ldquo;Wow this camera framing makes the scene feel more claustrophobic.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;Kyoko cutting this meat here is sort of ominous&hellip;&rdquo; And the fact that I noticed this stuff makes me feel like its too blatant. I&rsquo;m not immersed enough in the story to see past it during a first watch.</p>

<p>Additionally, I feel like the lack of security in the facility was a pretty big plot hole. But otherwise, I was pretty sold on the story. It was entertaining. It made me think. And while I wasn&rsquo;t a huge fan of the ending, I guess it did surprise me. And the movie did make me think about the whole AI thing. But I don&rsquo;t know. The movie sort of gave me a wannabe-intellectual vibe. I guess I am a wannabe intellectual though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really disappointed with this show. After seeing Ping Pong, Tatami Galaxy, and now Devilman Crybaby, I&rsquo;m now convinced that Ping Pong was the exception to Yuasa&rsquo;s otherwise unremarkable directorial collection.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with Crybaby&rsquo;s positives. Nice soundtrack. Stylistic (but also sorta shitty) animation. Miki MVP. Her character was made out to be the perfect human being. I guess it worked, since I liked her. Last, but definitely not least for positives: the low-life rappers. They were the highlight of the show for me. Apart from the excellent rapping in both English and Japanese (great job, Netflix), they embodied what&rsquo;s good in the world. They got dealt a bad hand and they have no future, yet they&rsquo;re the most caring and upstanding group of people in the show.</p>

<p>Onto the negatives. First and foremost, the story was incredibly rushed. I felt absolutely nothing when Akira&rsquo;s parents died. They were introduced and died within the span of an episode. Am I supposed to feel bad because I was given a few half-assed flashbacks where Akira is running after his parents? Come on. There&rsquo;s so much senseless violence packed into the first few episodes that by the end of the show, I don&rsquo;t really care if humanity is ending. Woop dee doo. More people dying. Been there done that. This series had potential, but it should&rsquo;ve been 24 episodes, not 10. There were so many details that weren&rsquo;t fleshed out. The demon-transformation mechanics were completely random. The fights were un-impactful (I really thought they were gonna do something with Silene and Xenon, but nope. They just died right away). And around episode 7 or so, Yuasa decided &ldquo;Hmm we need to transition to this Holy War real quick. Let&rsquo;s put a Bible and the number 666 in a scene and just dive right in.&rdquo; Apart from the pacing being bad from a plot perspective, it also took away any investment I had in the characters. &ldquo;I guess random shit is gonna happen and people are gonna die for no reason.&rdquo; Oh yeah, also no character growth.</p>

<p>And holy shit, there were so many contrived moments. Given the holy war, we could call it Deus Ex Machina. Psycho Jenny says &ldquo;Let him go&rdquo; (WHY????). Miki&rsquo;s corpse randomly gets transported back to her house so Akira can see it. Ryo is the best hacker in the world. Oh, speaking of Ryo, &ldquo;HAHA, I&rsquo;m Satan! But I have no memories! How convenient!&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t believe it. Downgrading this show from a 3 to a 2, I&rsquo;m in disbelief just typing up these words. I can accept non-realistic premises. But you can&rsquo;t just litter your show with plot conveniences.</p>

<p>Other things that pissed me off: The bullshit ending with Ryo gaining emotions. The in-your face baton passing flashbacks. And Miki being relegated to damsel in distress.</p>

<p>Any grand takeaways from the show? Well, they sort of pushed &ldquo;Humans are the real demons&rdquo; in our faces. I guess, it did showcase the fallacies of mob mentality decently well&hellip; But no real depth.</p>

<p>Okay, one last point, because any review of Devilman Crybaby has to address it. This show was disgusting. The very first episode, with the Sabbath orgy was awful. At first, I thought there might be some artistic purpose to it, but no not really. I continued to be disgusted throughout the entire show. Additionally, all the casual violence and sex/drugs really put a damper on any real shock when it would be warranted (i.e. Akira&rsquo;s parents getting boomed). Honestly, I&rsquo;m impressed at the show&rsquo;s continuous ability to disgust me. I would&rsquo;ve thought I&rsquo;d be desensitized by the second half. Nope. Miko continuing to fuck the rapist after killing him left me physically shaking my head. I think the only degenerate scene that felt like it contributed positively to the show was Taro eating his mom.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the original Ju-on (or The Grudge), so I&rsquo;m probably missing context, but I thought this show was terrible. Throughout the entire series, I was just confused. There was so much random stuff that happened for no reason. And then at the end, it&rsquo;s revealed that there&rsquo;s some wacky time loop crap that&rsquo;s happening. Oh yeah, and a guy spontaneously combusts. If the producers are gonna make a horror series with no semblance of a plot, you&rsquo;d think it would at least be scary. But nope. Just nonsensical. There was some thematic potential with the depiction of Kiyomi&rsquo;s tragic life and cycles of poverty/abuse. But it was completely wasted on this plot-hole-ridden piece of garbage.</p>

<p>Another day, another season. 8 episodes watched today, not bad. The cinematography continues to be top notch, and the audacity of the producers to come up with such an intricate plot is commendable. The show might have plot holes, but I cna&rsquo;t really tell. There&rsquo;s a constant stream of questions and answers, so I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if, after finishing up Season 3, I realize that certain points don&rsquo;t make much sense.</p>

<p>I will say that all the mental gymnastics does make the show slightly less enjoyable. That&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s bad, just my brain isn&rsquo;t big enough to appreciate Dark to its fullest. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a combination of translating subtitles, putting faces to names, remembering all the relationships/characters (there&rsquo;s like, what, 30 significant characters?), AND keeping track of 6 different interconnected timelines to boot. Add in time paradoxes and constant character/timeline transitions, and you get a show that takes a significant amount of effort to follow.</p>

<p>Season 2 continues to be a slow burn. I&rsquo;ve come to realize that&rsquo;s inherent to the style of the show. And that&rsquo;s accentuated by the drawn-out shots of the environment, people staring at each other, etc. But that actually works perfectly for this show, since it gives you time to think about what the hell is happening. Definitely not a show you&rsquo;re supposed to marathon 3 seasons in 4 days (woops).</p>

<p>Hannah&rsquo;s a baddie. Traveled back in time just to further torment Ulrich. Big yikes. Feels bad for Regina. She did nothing wrong.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, what the hell happened in the literal last minute of the last episode? Alternate timeline??? I&rsquo;d be so mad if I watched Season 2 before Season 3 came out and was left with that cliffhanger.</p>

<p>Another day, another season to review. Honestly, Season 3 was a bit of a drag.  I&rsquo;ve already seen 18 hours of the same stuff happening over and over again. The reveals, betrayals, lies, truths&hellip; they all started to get a bit repetitive. As did the 20 second shots of people hugging every 20 minutes. While the production value remained constant (10 / 10), I would&rsquo;ve liked the pace to pick up rather than remain consistent. A lot happens plot-wise, but the tone set by the slow camera pans/zooms and somber soundtrack (among other things) made everything feel like it was happening at a crawl.</p>

<p>And while this shouldn&rsquo;t detract from the show objectively, at this point I was exhausted with trying to piece everything together. Especially with the introduction of so many new characters (e.g. Eve&rsquo;s son(s)) and plot elements (2 alternating timelines for 2 different worlds? And an origin world to boot?). I admit defeat. My IQ isn&rsquo;t high enough.</p>

<p>Quick tangent. This experience was sort of eye-opening. I was always somewhat perplexed as to why people, despite putting in effort, could barely scrape by in classes. I chalked it up to a difference in ability and effort. But I never truly understood how mentally exhausting it is to try to keep up. Given the nature of trying to marathon this show before my flight tomorrow, I was constantly bombarded with new information, without enough time to absorb it all. And after a certain point, I just gave up. I accepted that things were confusing, and that they would resolve themselves eventually. No need to fret about the little details, or capture the scene in its broader context. Just turn my brain off and enjoy the ride.</p>

<p>In terms of plot, felt a bit contrived at times. I guess the entire show&rsquo;s premise is paradoxical in nature, but certain questions were never resolved. How does the cycle restart? What was up with the 80s torture chamber/eye burning? What about the bursted eardrums for all the animals? What&rsquo;s the point of killing and lying and child abducting if there&rsquo;s a magical force that forces a certain path anyway (apparently, Jonas can&rsquo;t kill himself even if he tries to)? How does Claudia diverge from the infinite loop in the first place? How could she possibly know about the origin world, and that Regina lives there?</p>

<p>I would&rsquo;ve liked for the show to end with Jonas/Martha triggering the start of another infinite loop cycle in the origin world (rather than fading to ashes) to resolve some of the plot-holey points I mentioned above. But I understand the desire to break the cycle to conclude the series.</p>

<p>In terms of side stories, I felt like there wasn&rsquo;t good closure. Certain points felt rushed (Peter&rsquo;s demise at the hands of a random thug), and others felt a bit pointless (Did the prostitute serve any real purpose???), especially the last 2 episodes. So much screentime was devoted to various relationships that ultimately didn&rsquo;t matter. Yeah, it&rsquo;s cool to see how interconnected everyone is and the big picture. And it did make things feel more realistic. But I don&rsquo;t know. The show felt too long.</p>

<p>Cool animations for the time/world transitions. Really liked the mirror image used for Eve&rsquo;s world (it felt very jarring at first, seeing everyone&rsquo;s faces reversed). Very fitting ending it all with &ldquo;What a Wonderful World.&rdquo; Disappointed that we never find out what happened to Woller&rsquo;s eye :(</p>

<p>The plot was unimaginative (Wow, who would&rsquo;ve guessed that the dam was the problem?) and lacking in substance/real struggle. Frozen 2 sort of gets a pass though, since 1) it&rsquo;s a kids movie and 2) it&rsquo;s basically a musical. Still, it did feel like it was just trying to copy Frozen&rsquo;s success.</p>

<p>Disney animation continues to impress. Other&rsquo;s can come close through stylistic animation (Ghibli, Spiderverse), but in terms of raw quality and effects, there&rsquo;s no competition.</p>

<p>Holy shit, they killed Angela in Episode 1. I did not see that coming.</p>

<p>Season 4 had some great episodes. But as a whole, it didn&rsquo;t feel all that satisfying. Rather than an explosive finale, it was a few episodes of excitement, a few episodes of filler, a few episodes of side arc, an episode or 2 of finale, and then 3 episodes of slow-burn to top it off. The ending, with Elliot entering the parallel universe, felt very Fight Club-esque. I appreciate the novelty and surprise factor of the dissociative identity portrayal, but it wasn&rsquo;t to my taste.</p>

<p>Around episodes 5 or 6, we saw some side story arcs with a cancer center volunteer Santa as well as Olivia, the recovering drug addict. While not relevant to the main plot-line, I really enjoyed those scenes. It was sort of just refreshing watching these genuine human interactions with strangers. People bonding over misery. It was done really well.</p>

<p>One negative is that too much time was spent following Dom and Vera&rsquo;s stories. For a long time, I was super confused as to the relevance of Vera. Yeah, in the end, he was responsible for Elliot confronting his past. But Jesus Christ, it was done in such a contrived way. Forced therapy session. Give this guy a pschiatric license, he&rsquo;s way better than Krista. Nonetheless, I appreciate that Elliot&rsquo;s backstory was fully fleshed out. Raped by his Dad&hellip; I guess that explains the whole childhood trauma thing. It&rsquo;s not just &ldquo;haha I randomly jumped out a window.&rdquo; Speaking of backstories, Whiterose&rsquo;s back story was pretty good. Mostly the camera shot of the blood-covered white roses. Perfection.</p>

<p>Camera shots in general were super artsy. Especially all the overhead room-to-room shots. I also really enjoyed the static camera &ndash;&gt; pan to follow a person. Watching the camera framing was a treat in of itself.</p>

<p>Holy shit, that silent episode was done so well, I didn&rsquo;t even realize I already watched it. I guess I assumed it was completely noiseless, rather than no dialogue, but I can&rsquo;t believe I watched Episode 5 without realizing that there was no dialogue at all. Big kudos.</p>

<p>Pretty sure for big fish with billions/trillions of dollars, you can&rsquo;t just transfer all your money with 2 factor authentication. Sorta a copout hack, since it&rsquo;s not particularly realistic. I guess Whiterose was too big to fail otherwise, so they had to come up with something. Then again, if the Deus Group really does manipulate the entire world, is this really the end for the group?</p>

<p>Finally got around to the final 2 episodes of Rick and Morty Season 4. Every episode this season was creative, funny, and insane. The question isn&rsquo;t whether the creators were on drugs, it&rsquo;s how much did they take? Seriously, how do they come up with this shit.</p>

<p>Favorite episode was the vat of acid episode. On top of being funny, it felt somewhat meaningful with the whole lesson about consequences.</p>

<p>Only downside of this season was that there wasn&rsquo;t any overarching plot or character development. Each episode was pretty good in isolation, but we didn&rsquo;t see any changes in relationships, or progression of the Evil Morty plot. Also, not a huge fan of confident Morty.</p>

<p>This show started looked so promising to start. NYC gang wars, clean animation, and a competent protagonist&hellip; sign me up. Well, it went downhill real fast. Ash is the type of character I hate the most. Someone who&rsquo;s smart, cunning, and perfect in every way&hellip; yet somehow also incompetent. He commands a gang at age 17, is the smartest guy in the room, never misses a shot, and he&rsquo;s hackerman to boot. Yet somehow he always ends up in the dumbest of situations. He literally tried to assassinate a guy in broad daylight while standing on a moving semi.</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s Eiji. Completely useless. I don&rsquo;t even want to talk about him. The main cast sucks, and basically every likable character dies a few episodes after being introduced. Also, why are there 5+ people gay for Ash. It feels so contrived.</p>

<p>The setup for the plot, with the banana fish drug is interesting. But there&rsquo;s so many garbage tangents and sticky situations (that shouldn&rsquo;t have happened in the first place) that just made the show unwatchable.</p>

<p>Dropped this show half-way through.</p>

<h3 id="horizon-zero-dawn-horizon-8-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Zero_Dawn" target="_blank">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>: 8 / 10</h3>

<p>Not finished with the game yet, but might as well write the review now, since I&rsquo;m not playing 6 hours every day anymore.</p>

<p>First thing&rsquo;s first, the game&rsquo;s beautiful. I think this might actually be the first game where I&rsquo;m making full use of my 1080 TI. 1440p ultra settings @ 60-70 fps. The best looking game I&rsquo;ve played by far.</p>

<p>I loved the setting: primitive weapons/towns scattered around a natural landscape with machine enemies and ruins. Back in my Skyrim days, I loved the stealth archer playstyle, and that&rsquo;s exactly what we have with Horizon Zero Dawn. Sneaking around enemy camps, and slowly sniping people. Not exactly an adrenaline rush, but I like it. Getting a headshot with a bow and arrow just feels so satisfying.</p>

<p>Combat is great too. In contrast to the Witcher, where you sort of just hack/slash/dodge, and occasionally put up a few spells, the various weapons and playstyles necessary to deal with all the enemies makes the combat fresh, even 25 hours in. Sometimes, I&rsquo;ll rush in with my ropecaster, tie down the enemy sawtooth, override it, and hide in a bush with some popcorn. Other times, I&rsquo;ll sneak into position, clear all the watchers, fire off a tearblast arrow, ignite a blaze canister with some fire arrows, then finish off the snapmaw with a flurry of hardpoints.</p>

<p>Story isn&rsquo;t all that spectacular, and side quests are all the same (follow some tracks, fight some enemies, get some mediocre rewards). But the gameplay definitely makes up for that deficiency.</p>

<p>I loved The Boys, and I&rsquo;m excited to watch season 2. The humor&rsquo;s bold, provocative, and questionable at times but genuinely funny. The writers didn&rsquo;t hold back, endlessly poking fun at corporate America and religion, among other things. Also, I can&rsquo;t get over the fact that a character is legitimately named &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s Milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing special about the production quality, but I&rsquo;ll stay around for the plot and characters. I love how everyone has a backstory - not just The Boys and Homelander. The Deep&rsquo;s character arc is so random, but my favorite part of the series by far. What a clown.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, the best eastern animation I&rsquo;ve seen. Holy shit, everything&rsquo;s so HD. Every single establishing shot is wallpaper-worthy.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ve already seen Unlimited Budget-works, the plot wasn&rsquo;t particularly surprising. The first half of the movie was basically a speed-run through all the necessary setup (which I appreciate), and the second half was a series of cool fights (did I mention how beautiful everything looks?). So nothing interesting plot-wise, but I view Presage Flower as a movie that simply sets the stage for an explosive 2nd/3rd movie. Super excited.</p>

<p>It started off with a lot of potential. The premise was interesting, and I was pretty spooked after watching the first few episodes. But the series sort of went nowhere from there. Every episode was really just more of the same. A bunch of tension as ultimately nothing of substance happens. And the series ends exactly as expected from the first episode. With all the mystery surrounding the murders, one would expect some sort of twist. I guess the twist was that there was no twist.</p>

<p>I will give the series credit though. The jump cuts where the camera focused on parallel objects were well executed, and the shot selection really added to the claustrophobia of the residency. It was also interesting to see how terrible MC&rsquo;s life could get.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna sugarcoat it, this finale was bad. I watched it for the sake of completion, but the only redeeming quality was some of the side character interactions (Komachi MVP). Animation quality was sub-par (where&rsquo;s the budget???): still frames and static shots everywhere. Dialogue wasn&rsquo;t great, but I&rsquo;ll blame the Crunchyroll translators for that one. Plot? Nonexistent. The entire season revolved around planning a prom. I repeat. They spent the entire season planning a prom. It&rsquo;s not like there was even any character development happening in the background. Just a slow burn towards the inevitable ending. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it, we&rsquo;re done here.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, anime Breath of the Wild, it can run on mobile, and it&rsquo;s freeâ€½ I&rsquo;ve never actually played Breath of the Wild, but holy cow this game is good. Thank God for whales, supporting my free-to-play adventures. There&rsquo;s actually so much content. I can&rsquo;t believe it. And all the attention to detail. The dialogue, character interactions, almost everything about the gameplay is great.</p>

<p>I love open-world games with beautiful scenery. And there&rsquo;s a whole lot to explore in this game. It&rsquo;s not super HD like Horizon Zero Dawn, but it&rsquo;s stylistic and gorgeous in its own way. In particular, I love just walking around the Geo region, taking in the atmosphere, beating up slimes, and listening to the soundtrack. I gotta say it - the music in this game has no right to be so good. Orchestral video game music always gets my stamp of approval, and Genshin delivers a lot of it. It&rsquo;s actually so good. I can&rsquo;t stop listening to the OST.</p>

<p>In terms of negatives, the resin system sucks, I hate that story content is gated behind grinding for adventure rank, and of course, it&rsquo;s a gacha game. And my luck has been terrible. One of my friends has four 5-stars. I have zero. Yeah yeah yeah, Genshin is pretty generous in the amount of free characters they give you. But why does my luck have to be so bad? At the very least, it&rsquo;s eye-opening to wirtness a gacha system in action. I refuse to spend any money on this game, because it&rsquo;s clear to see just how slippery of a slope it is to becoming a whale.</p>

<p>Holy shit, I loved every second of this movie. The amazing world-building of the series speaks for itself, and the animation is exactly what one would expect from this sort of movie. What I want to talk about is Bondrewd. He&rsquo;s the best movie villain, anime or not, that I&rsquo;ve seen in a very long time. It seems like he legitimately doesn&rsquo;t understand empathy and just wants to conduct Abyss science. But combine that with his dispicable actions, and you get phenomenal villain. The best villains don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re doing anything wrong.</p>

<p>I sort of had a feeling Prushka was gonna get boomed, but holy cow. Bondrewed manipulated a kid into loving him, then cut her up and absorbed all her positive energy. That&rsquo;s some psycho shit.</p>

<p>Only complaints are that the final battle felt a bit rushed (Bondrewd was basically invincible and 5 moves ahead of the gang, then he just got laser zapped from the side) and that there was some random sexualization thrown in. Oh also, Prushka was merely a plot device. Otherwise, I don&rsquo;t know what else to say. This movie was defined by Bondrewd, and it was great. So yeah, stop playing Splatoon Mr. Author, and keep writing this masterpiece.</p>

<p>Wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should give this a 7 (good and enjoyable, but unmemorable) or 8 (Excellent, but a few problems preventing it from being top tier), so I just settled for 7.5.</p>

<p>The story itself was quite predictable. We saw a chess savant rise from nothing, beat almost everyone on her path to the top, falter, fall, hit rock bottom, and come back stronger to win it all. Nonetheless, the beautiful set-work and directing kept me captivated, and I really enjoyed the 60s setting.</p>

<p>Despite its predictability, Beth&rsquo;s growth as a person was great to see. She started off as a psycho, and became slightly less of a psycho (Can&rsquo;t believe she didn&rsquo;t pay back Mr. Shaibel&hellip;). The acting during rock-bottom was great. Some of the sub-plots were a bit forced (i.e. Morphy comparisons), but it was never too in-your-face. Also shoutouts to real chess moves (unlike Mr. Robot).</p>

<p>I also learned a few things. Namely, adjournment existed (it&rsquo;s bullshit, it&rsquo;s cheating), and they tranquilized orphans in the 60s (I liked this aspect of the plot).</p>

<p>Overall, fun watch.</p>

<p>As someone who already has a decent understanding of how companies like Facebook/Google operate, I didn&rsquo;t find The Social Dilemma as particularly enlightening. In fact, most of the statements were over-simplified explanations that put big tech in a bad light. At first, I thought it was okay, since its clearly catered towards the general population and it raised some interesting points. But after about an hour, I gave up and went to play some Melee. There was no new information being said, they just kept repeating the idea that big tech is writing software to manipulate peoples&rsquo; psychology (true to an extent).</p>

<p>What really killed this for me was the acted-out scenes in between interview snippets. The scenes where the AI is manipulating the teenager to buy things and act certain ways is so misleading, one might even consider it fake news. Like, the documentary complains about big tech enabling fake news&hellip; and here they are having these little AI personas scheme to get a guy back on social media with the perfect notification. Simply absurd.</p>

<p>Also Netflix is also big tech, just saying.</p>

<p>Season 3 was pretty crazy at first with the return of Dio and the OP Pokemon (stands?), but got a bit repetitive towards the end. Some crazy fight where you have no idea how the main cast is gonna get out of it, and then they pull something out of nowhere. This season was full of memes (Ohhh Maiii Gawwwdd), and I loved the return of Joseph Joestar. The rest of the cast wasn&rsquo;t particularly charismatic though, and after so many episodes, the craziness of Jojo sort of got normalized. Overall, entertaining, but not particularly memorable.</p>

<p>Overall, a very pretty but sad war film. With the first scene, you know how things end. All that&rsquo;s left is to watch the trainwreck in slow motion. That being said, I really appreciated the scenes of Seita and Setsuko enjoying life and having fun, despite their shitty circumstances.</p>

<p>But overall, the movie didn&rsquo;t leave too much of an impression on me. For sure, I appreciated the depiction of how war devastates families, especially children. But some of Seita&rsquo;s decisions were just so dumb, it was a bit hard to empathize at times. Yeah yeah, I get that there&rsquo;s a message about pride and how Japan refused to swallow its own. But looking at the movie without that context, all I can do is witness Seita&rsquo;s decisions and shake my head.</p>

<p>If the rest of the seasons are anything like the first, I can say for sure that House of Cards is a masterpiece. It&rsquo;s up there with Breaking Bad. Frank&rsquo;s a baaaad man. I don&rsquo;t even know what to say. All the scheming and conspiring, it&rsquo;s beautiful to see. I wonder what percent of Congress is like Frank and what percent is bumbling around like Donald (Blythe? Trump?).</p>

<p>Some thoughts on characters:
-Christina is like Jesse Pinkman. The show&rsquo;s source of purity.
-I feel bad for Peter Russo. Yeah, he brought his actions upon himself, but he really did want to improve himself. It&rsquo;s a shame.
-Doug is the ultimate lackey.
-Freddy&rsquo;s cool.
-Zoe sort of annoyed me towards the end. Her rise was way too fast. And all the deceit and blackmail for what? A story? Guess there&rsquo;s a reason I&rsquo;m not a journalist.</p>

<p>Holy shit, they killed Zoe in episode 1. I&rsquo;m gonna be honest here, at the time of writing this, I&rsquo;m already halfway through Season 3. And I can&rsquo;t remember the particulars of S2 without going back and double-checking. But just look at how fast I&rsquo;m going through this show. I obviously love it.</p>

<p>Some thoughts on characters:
-Doug is still the ultimate lackey. He&rsquo;s addicted though.
-I like Jackie. She&rsquo;s a snake, like Frank.
-Elon (Raymond) Tusk is an okay antagonist.
-RIP Walker. He did nothing wrong.
-Claire is a bad woman.
-Did I mention that Frank is a bad man?</p>

<p><strong>After Part 1 (Ch. 1-3):</strong>
Wow, first novel I&rsquo;m attempting to read in a while. Thanks for letting me borrow your Kindle, Yuansong. I get that this is a science fiction book, but I&rsquo;m super into the Cultural Revolution setting that the book starts off in. My Chinese History was never strong, and seeing this sort of historical fiction is actually really cool, especially considering the book is originally in Chinese.</p>

<p>That being said, I can&rsquo;t get over how amateur-ish the storytelling feels. Maybe it&rsquo;s because of a cultural difference, maybe it&rsquo;s because of the translation. But the dialogue is soooo bad. No one talks the way the characters talk. The back-and-forth during Wenjie&rsquo;s struggle session felt like something an over-eager academic with zero experience writing prose would come up with. Also, the amount of exposition everything&rsquo;s given feels almost insulting. Like the reader can&rsquo;t figure anything out themselves and needs to be directly told what to notice. For example, in Ch. 4 (yeah I&rsquo;m going back to give examples), this is written: &ldquo;On the faces of everyone around the table, Wang could read one sentiment: Weâ€™ve done all we can. Letâ€™s fucking get it over with, already.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s so blunt and insulting. Later on, &ldquo;You know what she used? A frozen tilapia she got out of the freezer.&rdquo; Jesus Christ, who would&rsquo;ve guessed the fish from the freezer is frozen.</p>

<p>That being said, this book is critically acclaimed, and there&rsquo;s a lot more to see. Things start to get interesting in Chapter 3, and it&rsquo;s clear the author has an inventive imagination. Let&rsquo;s see where this goes.</p>

<p><strong>After Ch 14:</strong>
Alright, things are starting to get spicy. Wang Miao is experiencing some really funky things, and this Three Body sword art online game is pretty neat.  I am 40% done, and it still feels like exposition though. All the science/EE stuff seems to check out though, so that&rsquo;s a plus.</p>

<p><strong>Ch. 16:</strong>
 This is a meme. A computer with gates made out of 30 million Chinese soldiers holding flags.</p>

<p><strong>Finished Part 2:</strong>
Alright, the cat&rsquo;s out of the bag now. After <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> exposition, we&rsquo;re set up for the main event. My opinion of this book will rest on the final execution. A few questions remain. How was the photograph/vision countdown possible? How does the &ldquo;Physics doesn&rsquo;t exist&rdquo; realization manifest itself? Was there any purpose to the whole Cultural Revolution exposition? And of course, what&rsquo;s the final conclusion?</p>

<p>The dialogue in recent chapters has been more bearable (I just treat it the same as the omniscient narrator at this point). It&rsquo;s because the author&rsquo;s strong point is his imagination and world-building, which is finally manifesting. Reading a sci-fi novel again after so long, it&rsquo;s refreshing to think about ideas I&rsquo;d never think about playing video games, watching movies, and living day-to-day life. The obvious example is what civilization would look like in a three-sun system. But also just thinking about the passage of time on a grander scale, and other topics I can&rsquo;t remember off the top of my head. Excited to see what&rsquo;s next.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p><strong>Finished: 11/26/2020</strong>
In the end, I was disappointed by the book. Rather than any sort of conflict resolution, plot progression, or character development, I&rsquo;m presented with an in-depth explanation of things I ultimately didn&rsquo;t care about. The ETO factions, the Panama Canal operation, Trisolaran scientific progress, etc&hellip; all sort of cool I guess. But I finished the book feeling like I read a prologue to the next book. The entire book can be summarized as &ldquo;Jaded orphan contacts aliens and betrays humanity. Here&rsquo;s how the communication occurred. By the way, here&rsquo;s a cool scenario to imagine (Three-Body).&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t believe how high the praise is for this book, given the author&rsquo;s writing and storytelling abilities.</p>

<p>Maybe if we continuously followed Ye Wenjie&rsquo;s story, things could have been more engrossing? I don&rsquo;t know. The way characters are presented (+shitty dialogue), they feel like story-telling constructs rather than real people. The author is great at world-building at the macro level, but couldn&rsquo;t fill in the micro details or tell the story in an engrossing way.</p>

<p>Whenever the author started explaining scientific concepts, I immediately skipped the next few paragraphs. I came here for fiction, not a summary of quantum mechanics/EE/etc. The coexistence of a scientific foundation and future technology that&rsquo;s essentially magic (Trisolaran sophons) was also quite jarring. Yeah, the countdown and the weird LHC results were explained, but I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with the answers given.</p>

<p>Exploring string theory (11-dimensions inside a proton) and quantum entanglement was pretty neat I guess. And the struggles of Trisolaris to escape annihilation is something I never would have thought of. And seeing the fictional Cultural Revolution backstory of Ye Wenjie was interesting. But ultimately, I took more away from the Author&rsquo;s Note than the book itself. I&rsquo;m gonna copy a quote I like from it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a strange contradiction revealed by the naivete and kidness demonstrated by humanity when faced with the universe: On Earth, humankind can step onto another continent, and without thought, destroy the kindred civilizations found there through warfare and disease. But when they gaze up at the stars, they turn sentimental and believe that if extraterrestrial intelligences exist, they must be civilizations bound by universal, noble constraints, as if cherishing and loving different forms of life are part of a self-evident universal code of conduct. I think it should be precisely the opposite. Let&rsquo;s turn the kidnness we show toward the stars to members of the human race on Earth and build up the trust and understanding between the different peoples and civilizations that make up humanity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m home for Thanksgiving/Christmas and wanted to show my family my favorite movie of all time. It was cool noticing previously missed details, and the movie is undoubtedly still 10 / 10. But I was pretty sad watching it. Dad appreciated it, but Mom was just confused the entire time, and my sister spent half the movie texting her friends. I guess some people just have different tastes.</p>

<p>The 30 minute movie/music video itself was sorta artsy, but also sorta wack. I&rsquo;d give it a 6 / 10..</p>

<p>The real reason I&rsquo;m writing this is because I decided to go and read all the My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy lyrics and annotations on Genius. And I gotta say, Kanye is a genius. The Strokes have a special place in my heart, but Ye is just something else. Best album of all time. Food, movies, music - Everything&rsquo;s better when you take the time to pay attention to the details.</p>

<p>Also found some great songs along the way. &ldquo;If you fall on the concrete, that&rsquo;s your ass fault&rdquo; - See Me Now.</p>

<p>After reading Three Body Problem, I felt a strong urge to read something written with more eloquence. Thank God for Cormac McCarthy, writing dialogue that doesn&rsquo;t make me wince.</p>

<p>Overall, I liked the book. It was a depressing and sometimes repetitive read, and I didn&rsquo;t get from it any grand ideas or revelations. Instead, it was a beautiful showcase of love, resilience, and the human condition. Actions speak louder than words. Especially the little things. Giving the boy all the coffee, blaming himself for the boys&rsquo; forgetfulness, giving the old man food per request; it really was a marvelous demonstration of familial love.</p>

<p>I also think it&rsquo;s so beautiful that the man forced himself to keep surviving for the sake of the boy. 25% of the way into the book, I myself lost hope. Really I was just hoping the man would have the guts to pull the trigger. To mercy kill the boy when/if the time came (Spoiler: he didn&rsquo;t). There&rsquo;s no logical reason to keep going. But there&rsquo;s something so human about trying anyway.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t like the ending too much - it felt like a bit of a cop-out. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant read, full of vivid imagery (ironic) and somber reflection.</p>

<p>Ep 1-3 Release schedule is pretty scuffed. First three episodes premiering during work hours, really?</p>

<p>I think anyone unfamiliar with melee would be pretty confused with the actual content. But as someone who followed the scene since 2013, when the first documentary came out, I loved every second of Metagame.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really cool seeing the rise of the various Gods in the timespan between the end of the first doc, and my entry into melee. In particular, I loved PPMD&rsquo;s story arc. That Pound V montage? Perfection. Stack. It. Up.</p>

<p>Ep 4-6 continued to entertain. No new information here for me, but it was cool to re-live the golden age of Melee, back when the scene was at its peak. But pretty terrible for any newcomers. Jagged timelines, toxic drama, etc.</p>

<p>Ep 7-8 featured My B and PPMD winning Apex 2015, my favorite tournament of all time. Overall, enjoyable documentary. Did it have problems? Absolutely. But people are over-blowing the whole &ldquo;Leffen character assassination&rdquo; thing. Leffen was definitely a jerk at the time. If he doesn&rsquo;t like his past portrayal, he shouldn&rsquo;t have embraced the villain role. Poorly paced, overly ambitious, and terrible from an outsider point of view. But for me, I liked it. Stack. It. Up.</p>

<p><strong>Book 1</strong>
Holy cow, Dune is amazing so far. This is exactly my type of book. An epic fantasy story full of political machinations and mysteries to solve. It&rsquo;s sci-fi Game of Thrones, but with better writing. One small gripe is that the small Princess Irulan blurbs ruin any suspense, but I guess it&rsquo;s about the journey not the destination. Otherwise, I love the setup, lets see how the next third delivers. Also, thank god for competent characters. It&rsquo;s just great storytelling. Paul is sort of OP though.</p>

<p>As expected, Pixar animation quality is unrivaled. Absolutely jaw-dropping. No one can match their creativity either. The You Seminar world was stunningly imaginative. Those aspects by themselves push Soul into 8 / 10 range. Plot itself was pretty cookie-cutter Pixar though. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I grew up, but the character development and ending &ldquo;plot twist&rdquo; was fully anticipated from the first 10 minutes. The overall message about &ldquo;finding a spark&rdquo; and living life, helping others, finding your true self, etc was cool though I guess. Ultimately, nice but unmemorable.</p>
