                <p>This morning, I woke up at 4:30 to drop my family off at the airport. I didn&rsquo;t get much sleep last night - I wasn&rsquo;t really tired until 11, and then I stayed up for another hour when the Kawhi/PG news broke. It was a 45 minute drive to the airport and too early for anyone to feel like talking much. Spent some time hugging everyone and saying goodbye, and that was it. Now I&rsquo;m on my own.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling pretty empty right now. I feel like this happens every time I say goodbye. Just a feeling of emptiness. Wishing that old times could last forever. Regretting not making more out of that time.</p>

<p>Wrapping up college was basically the same. I knew going into my last semester that this was it. My last 4 months living in a dream. I was content knowing I made the most out of it, and I was more or less mentally prepared to move on. After the degree ceremony in Cameron, we all got together and took our final pictures together. Gordon came over, gave me a hug, and said something along the lines of &ldquo;Goodbye forever, son.&rdquo; And I just broke down crying. I guess I wasn&rsquo;t actually prepared for the reality that it was all over today. The next day, I drove home with my (actual) dad, all my emotions replaced with a numb emptiness.</p>

<p>I guess I&rsquo;m supposed to say something meaningful rather than just relive my memories. In the end, a degree doesn&rsquo;t really mean anything. It&rsquo;s just an (expensive) piece of paper. The <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessTreasureTwist" target="_blank">real treasure</a> was the friends I made along the way (but unironically). There ya go.</p>

<p>I really do think college was and will be the best time of my life. There was freedom to do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. Classes were never too hard, and all my friends lived within 10 minutes of me. I had everything I needed, and almost everything I wanted. I really will miss college. But I guess there&rsquo;s only so much use in reminiscing. And hey - it&rsquo;s not like the future&rsquo;s a bleak, miserable existence. A lot of my friends are living in the area, and I&rsquo;m working at an exciting company where I get to learn from the best. I&rsquo;m living in the middle of restaurant heaven and in close proximity to some beautiful national parks. And there&rsquo;s no more tests, no more applications, no more interviews.</p>

<p>To be honest, it doesn&rsquo;t truly feel like I graduated. The last few summers started the same way, just with internships rather than a full-time job. Nonetheless, I&rsquo;m slowly waking up from 4 years living in a dream. But that&rsquo;s fine. The real world&rsquo;s cool too.</p>
