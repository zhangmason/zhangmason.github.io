<h3 id="matrix-2-matrix2-7-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/" target="_blank">Matrix 2</a>: 7 / 10</h3>

<p>I liked Matrix 2 even more than the first Matrix. With the scene already set, we get to dive even deeper into the Matrix, following fully unleased Neo and Agent Smith, among other charismatic characters (I love the Keymaker). Matrix 2 features even better production quality, hype extended fights, and a layered story with a lot of moving parts. Matrix 2 is a bit in your face about the existential philosophy, but I enjoyed it. Great movie.</p>

<h3 id="ponyo-ponyo-9-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0876563/" target="_blank">Ponyo</a>: 9 / 10</h3>

<p>Honestly, this may be my second favorite Ghibli film after Spirited Away. It has a simple premise and story, but the entire movie is magical, playful, and fun to watch. The setting and the animation is beautiful. I&rsquo;ve never seen waves done that way, and all the water scenes were mesmerizing.</p>

<p>Fish-form Ponyo looks really derpy, but in an endearing way. Lisa is awesome and has a great sense of style. Feels bad for Kumiko.</p>

<p>Demon Slayer is undoubtedly one of the defining animes of our generation. Season 2 solidifies this and somehow manages to top episode 19, which I previously described as &ldquo;straight up my favorite animation sequence of all time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The story itself is pretty cookie cutter. Like before, the real magic comes from the animation. We get about 6 straight episodes of flashy fighting between Tengen/main trio and Lower Six, and boy does it deliver. I feel like a broken record every time I praise Ufotable for their animation. It&rsquo;s the best I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that.</p>

            <figcaption class="center"  style="color: grey;" >Random screencap from episode 6</figcaption>
        
    </figure>



<p>In terms of characters, I actually really liked Tengen. His constant exasperation when dealing with Zenitsu/Inosuke felt so relatable. Zenitsu continues to be one of my most hated characters. He wasn&rsquo;t that annoying this season, but in my opinion, that&rsquo;s because the author copped out by having him fight while asleep for 6 straight episodes. A real cop out. Overall, not a huge fan of Demon Slayer characters. Tanjiro&rsquo;s cool, but Inosuke&rsquo;s annoying, and I maintain that Nezuko is a cheap plot trick. The upper six duo was cool conceptually, and the brother/sister parallel was neat, but didn&rsquo;t like them much either. This season also overdid it a bit with the deus ex machina family visions.</p>

<p>I feel like a lot of Demon Slayer&rsquo;s humor is a miss for me, but it actually worked pretty well for Season 2. Maybe I&rsquo;m devolving, but I thought it was pretty funny when Tengen couldn&rsquo;t deliver his final words in the final episode.</p>

<p>That being said, I want to re-iterate that Demon Slayer&rsquo;s animation is the best around. Every Sunday was 20 minutes of pure audiovisual joy. While I have my gripes with the characters, the show is really exciting to watch, and that&rsquo;s what matters.</p>

<h3 id="the-batman-batman-4-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877830/" target="_blank">The Batman</a>: 4 / 10</h3>

<p>Batman will forever like in Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s shadow. No reboot will ever come close.</p>

<p>This 2022 reboot, featuring Robert Pattison and the Riddler, differentiated itself by taking a much darker, noir approach while maintaining an ambitious plot and philosophical undertones. Ultimately, it fell flat. I bet if I read a bullet point of all the main plot events, I&rsquo;d think the movie seemed pretty good. But the execution was all wrong. That&rsquo;s my main gripe with the movie - on paper, there was so much potential. Wasted.</p>

<p>A lot of the scenes were way too long or altogether unnecessary. During the Penguin car chase, I kept thinking to myself, &ldquo;Is it almost over yet?&rdquo; It was like 5 minutes long or something, and nothing was accomplished in terms of plot, character, or entertainment. In fact, the constant jump cuts and chaotic nature of the shots gave me a small headache. The exact same movie could&rsquo;ve been presented in 30 minutes less. Stripping away the Penguin subplot would shave off another 30 minutes and make the movie even better. Yeah, it ties into the rest of the story, but it just wasn&rsquo;t executed in a satisfying way. Felt like we put the main plot on pause for 30 minutes. Same thing with the romance subplot. The execution was just terrible. This version of Batman is not romantic, and it detracted from the story if anything. See, it made sense in the Dark Knight because of obvious plot implications, but there was zero purpose in this movie. Plus the dialogue was pretty cringe. It was forced, like the characters were explaining the contrived plot to the audience rather than holding a real conversation.</p>

<p>In general, I was not a fan of the cinematography or editing. When the audience notices the editing, you know you&rsquo;ve done too much. Holy cow, there were so many jump cuts. Two people talking? Let&rsquo;s change the camera angle every 3 seconds, snip snap, snip snap, snip snap! And then there were so many just head shots where we stare at a character&rsquo;s face or back for extended periods of time as they walk. There were a few spots with cool cinmatography (e.g. epilepsy scene where Batman&rsquo;s manhandling Falconi&rsquo;s goons in a dark room), but overall a disappointment. I get that they were going for a claustrophobic feel, but it was just too much. Same thing with the dark color palette. Yeah yeah, it&rsquo;s a dark movie, I get it. 3 hours of it is not enjoyable.</p>

<p>Casting wasn&rsquo;t great outside Pattison, but maybe that&rsquo;s just because I love The Dark Knight. Why didn&rsquo;t Alfred have a British accent? Music was very generic and unmemorable. Even unfitting at times.</p>

<p>In terms of positives, I liked the Riddler&rsquo;s puzzles. It was fun to watch the chaos unfold as Batman struggled to figure everything out, and that kept the movie going. I will say, his unmasking and the finale was a bit of a meme. Turns out Riddler was an internet conspiracy theorist who gathered a bunch of other QAnons to storm the capitol. The whole &ldquo;rat with wings&rdquo; thing took way too long to figure out though. Oh also, there were a lot of plot non-sequiturs where things just happened coincidentally and it felt completely random. Like why did Penguin happen to be there with a gun when Falconi was shot? Damn, I wanted to end on a positive notes, but all I can think of is gripes. The movie had potential to be a lot better, let&rsquo;s just leave it at that.</p>
