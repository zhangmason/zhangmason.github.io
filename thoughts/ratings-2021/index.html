<p><strong>Book 1: 6 / 10</strong>
I was bored, browsed Netflix, saw this, figured I&rsquo;d see what all the hype was about. I&rsquo;d say this first arc was mostly just setup. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the characters, world-building, and general atmosphere are great. But nothing much of substance happens barring the first few and last few episodes. In between, we get episodic mini-adventures that tell childish lessons, and that&rsquo;s about it. Yeah yeah yeah, it&rsquo;s a children&rsquo;s show with 12 year old main characters so I&rsquo;ll cut it some slack.</p>

<p>General impressions:
Katara&rsquo;s my favorite character so far. Aang is a kiddie and Sokka is comedic relief. Zuko&rsquo;s a bit too jaded for my tastes. Looking forward to his character development.</p>

<p><strong>Book 2: 8 / 10</strong>
I really enjoyed this season. I love Toph (the blind gimmick especially) and Azula (something about being confidently yet charismatically evil has a special place in my heart) as characters, and the season did a really good job of tying old threads back into the story. Iroh continues to be MVP, and the plot is progressing at a good pace. The additional bending variety is also pretty neat. Zuko&rsquo;s a real mess though. I find it real hard to see how he&rsquo;s gonna redeem himself as a character.</p>

<p><strong>Book 3: 9 / 10</strong>
Okay, so almost a month later, I still haven&rsquo;t watched the final episode. Nonetheless, season three is definitely the highlight of the series. As Sozin&rsquo;s Comet approaches, we reach a point in the story in which there&rsquo;s very little filler. Character development has occurred, meaning cooler fights and less immaturity. We get throwbacks to previous episodes (welcome back, Suki), and in general, the show does a great job heading towards its climax.</p>

<p>Update: Sozin&rsquo;s Comet was pretty good.</p>

<p>I remember this being a good movie, but having some more perspective on what&rsquo;s important in life (other people) really makes it hit a lot harder. Beautifully written characters and impeccable acting by Matt Damon and Robin Williams.</p>

<p>A quality game. Much more than just &ldquo;2D Minecraft.&rdquo; Wheras minecraft really is a sandbox game, Terraria is moreso a survival game with a combat emphasis and clear-cut progression. While frustrating at times (fighting Plantera like 15 times), it&rsquo;s undoubtedly a great game.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny how opinions change. When I first watched AoT years ago, I never continued past the first season because I thought the characters were just way too bland. This time around, I still found Eren extremely annoying (Armin too, but slightly less so), but I didn&rsquo;t have a problem with the rest of them. In particular, Mikasa gets a pass on her clingy behavior and blatant op-ness, since her tragic backstory was actually pretty good. But in terms of the supporting cast, I enjoyed watching Jean change, and the rest of them don&rsquo;t get enough screen time to really matter.</p>

<p>The plot, action, and production quality are more than enough to make AoT worth watching, despite Eren being a whiny dumb-ass (Jeez I hate this guy). The premise is genius, and the show does a good job showcasing tragedy and death without being too in your face about it. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve grown up a bit (and I guess I&rsquo;ve watched more stuff), but I really appreciate seeing the bleak, hopeless side of an adrenaline-pumping action show.</p>

<p>Music is hype, animation is stunning (holy cow, this was made in 2013?), and I&rsquo;m super excited to binge the rest of the series.</p>

<p>Well, the production quality is still there, and the fights continue to be cool.  I want to highlight the music. Opening song is inspiring, battle music is hype, and I have a morbid fascination with the ending song. But I gotta say, the content of this season was pretty questionable. There were so many plot twists, that I have absolutely no idea what&rsquo;s gonna happen. Not like Game of Thrones where it keeps you on your feet, more like &ldquo;alright what kind of bullshit will they come up with this time.&rdquo; It also seems like this show has a reverse plot armor, where the bad guys never really lose. One final complaint - way too many flashbacks and tangential story lines. I really don&rsquo;t care about Sasha or Ymir&rsquo;s backstory.</p>

<p>That being said, the scene where Reiner just broke down and said &ldquo;Yo Eren, by the way, I&rsquo;m the armored titan&hellip;&rdquo; was pretty hilarious. Reiner and Berholdt as complex villains filled with regrets was done very well. Also want to point out that Erwin really showed his colors as a total bad-ass during that rescue sequence.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think this season wasn&rsquo;t very good if I step back and try to look at it objectively. I think the season was trying to do too much. But at least we&rsquo;re starting to get plot progression. Things are happening, mysteries are being uncovered, and we&rsquo;re learning that there&rsquo;s some sort of crazy conspiracy going on. The hype train don&rsquo;t stop, onto S3.</p>

<p>Season 3 was 4 / 10 at times and 11 / 10 at others.</p>

<p><strong>Negatives</strong>
* Okay, I can already see some see-into-the-future bull-shit coming from that &ldquo;Save Mikasa, Armin&rdquo; Owl quote. I have no doubt that the story would be better without it.
* Holy shit, why do the villains have so much plot-armor? Reiner should&rsquo;ve died like 5 times already
* Wasn&rsquo;t a fan of the whole Rod Reiss story line. I guess it makes sense with the overarching story, but I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; Maybe it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s so many events that happened in a very specific way to enable the plot as a whole, and the whole plotline just feels so bizzare and out-of-nowhere. Also, Historia&rsquo;s so damn unpredictable, and not in a good way.
* There isn&rsquo;t really much character development. Eren&rsquo;s less annoying, but I think that&rsquo;s just because there&rsquo;s less of a focus on him (and less of him yelling)</p>

<p><strong>Mixed-bag</strong>
* The plot is getting really convoluted&hellip; On one hand, it&rsquo;s so refreshing to see a story planned out from start to finish (cough George RR Martin cough). On the other, we dedicated like three whole episodes to explanatory flashbacks, and I&rsquo;m watching something entirely different from what I first started.
* I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about this blatant WW2 persecution parallel&hellip;
* I still have a lot of questions and see some potential plot holes. After seeing so many answers this season, I have some faith that they&rsquo;ll be answered, so we&rsquo;ll hold off on that judgement.</p>

<p><strong>Positives</strong>
* First and foremost, holy shit, episode 54 &ldquo;Hero&rdquo; is the single greatest anime episode I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Erwin went out like a badass, Levi shredded Monkey Man like a badass, and Armin sacrificed himself. Like a badass. Okay, I guess he lived, but still.
* That whole 6-episode sequence with re-taking Shiganshina was brilliant. The decision-making, animation, and choreography were all perfect.
* I love Erwin&rsquo;s character. He&rsquo;s a total badass and his self-admitted selfishness is so refreshing to watch.
* The whole save Armin vs Erwin dilemna was done well. At first, I thought it was 100% a mistake, but given Levi&rsquo;s 1-on-1 chat with Erwin, I guess it makes sense.
* I just recently came to appreciate how beautiful the sky is in this series. Of course, the animation, voice-acting, music, etc are all stellar in general.</p>

<p>** Miscellaneous **
* Monkey Man looking like Erwin&rsquo;s Dad was such a bait
* Well, I guess Mikasa has special blood, she&rsquo;s not just randomly super OP</p>

<p>That really is the theme of the movie. Tenet was a confusing mess. Beautiful and well-crafted, but a confusing mess nonetheless. I had absolutely no idea what was happening during my first watch-through. After reading some online resources (very well made diagram shown below), I re-watched the movie two weeks later. This time around, I actually understood what was happening. Nonetheless, a good movie shouldn&rsquo;t require Tenet&rsquo;s level of mental gymnastics, so I can&rsquo;t rate it that highly. I do have an appreciation for Nolan&rsquo;s misguided genius though.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t even attempt to tackle Tenet&rsquo;s plot holes. The entire premise is based on time paradoxes, so like the scientist lady said, I won&rsquo;t try to understand it. There are definitely inconsistencies in the story though.</p>

<p>Sound mixing was the worst I&rsquo;ve ever heard, no exaggeration. I&rsquo;m so glad I watched this at home with subtitles rather than in a theater.</p>

<p>Characters were very weak. I hated the whole Kat character arc (&ldquo;Everyone will die. &rdquo; &ldquo;Including my son?!&rdquo;), and the protagonist&rsquo;s obsession with her. There wasn&rsquo;t any real emotion or character depth/complexity.</p>

<p>All in all, a cool movie but with an overly-ambitious premise. Shoutouts to the final battle scene, a visual cacaphony of high budget action. I especially appreciated the scene where they blew up a building in forward and inverse at the same time.</p>

<p>After watching the mess that was Tenet, a chill Ghibli movie was well-appreciated. Story was pretty ordinary, but the creativity that went into this movie was special. In particular, I liked seeing all the ways the little people interacted with real-sized objects.</p>

<p>I was not a fan of this season. I have to start off by talking about the CGI. My God, my eyes were bleeding during episode 6. I was pretty excited up until that point, and then the CGI just killed all my hype. I get that there was a time crunch to produce this season, but CGI&rsquo;ing human characters? It&rsquo;s so noticeable, especially after AoT put together some of the best animation ever seen in the previous season. It didn&rsquo;t help how different the characters looked with the new studio + 4 year time skip.</p>

<p>Speaking of characters, I&rsquo;m very disappointed with Eren&rsquo;s character writing. At this point, he&rsquo;s a completely different character. There was no buildup to this change, simply a 4 year time skip and a completely new character, throwing out everything from the previous 3 seasons. The table scene where Eren lays it down on Armin and Mikasa was inexcusable. Nothing he does from this point on can redeem his character. That&rsquo;s not even mentioning the hypocrisy of his genocidal actions and all the people dying because of him - friend and foe. The 180 in characterization is so extreme that I&rsquo;d consider it bad writing. Even if there&rsquo;s some excuse further down the line (mind control, double agent, etc), I don&rsquo;t see how my opinion will change.</p>

<p>I respect the AoT&rsquo;s writing and how it takes time to follow the &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; side. The moral ambiguity, world-building, and plot progression are top notch as expected. But the downgrade in production value, change in characterization, and fact that this show is completely different from what I originally signed up for ruined the experience for me.</p>

<p>Also, I hate Gabi&rsquo;s character. Yeah, sure she&rsquo;s a brainwashed kid. Doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that she&rsquo;s annoying. Constantly uses the fact that she&rsquo;s a little kid to commit war crimes and kill empathetic enemies. Not to mention that she shouldn&rsquo;t have the capabilities to kill the people she killed. Imagine surviving years of grusome war just to get shot by a little kid.</p>

<h3 id="minari-minari-8-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10633456/" target="_blank">Minari</a>: 8 / 10</h3>

<p>Minari is a nice slice of life film that I found to be very relatable. While the main cast was a Korean family moving to rural Arkansas (rather than a Chinese family in Minnesota), a lot of Jacob&rsquo;s mannerisms were very similar to my dad&rsquo;s. Right from the get-go, we&rsquo;re presented with a lower-class immigrant father with dreams of making it big in the US. While I won&rsquo;t point out all of the similarities (Some of them hit a bit too close to home), I will say that the beginning scene where Jacob asks his family to sleep together on the floor is exactly the type of strange joke (is it a joke?) that my dad would tell.</p>

<p>While I haven&rsquo;t lived in the country, the whole movie felt very real. Not in a No Country for Old Men way where the dialogue is simple and realistic rather than script-like and entertaining. But in a relatable &ldquo;these character interactions are exactly what I&rsquo;ve seen in real life&rdquo; sort of way. The way Anne helped out and did things with her little brother at times while expressing annoyance at others was spot on. So was the casual racism that everyone in the film just accepted/ignored and didn&rsquo;t make a big deal of. And the dichotomy of Jacob/Monica&rsquo;s relationship. Again, the keyword for this movie is &ldquo;relatable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Close to the ground and wide camera shots made the movie feel more personal, as if you were physically there and taking in the scenery. A low-key musical score helped with this and was very fitting.</p>

<p>I do wish the movie did a bit more to tie together some of the earlier scenes. The minari motif felt very weak (and forced into the ending), and I thought there would be more to the snake in the woods, Mountain Dew, and paper airplanes, among other things.</p>

<p>Overall, a very pleasing movie. I&rsquo;ll recommend it to my family.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed Castle in the Sky. For some reason, I imagined it being similar to Totoro, where nothing much of substance happens. But there was actually a decent(albeit simple) story, which I enjoyed. The soundtrack, worldbuilding, and animation are gorgeous and hold up very well 35 years later. Probably top 3 Ghibli for me, after Spirited Away and Mononoke.</p>

<p>Another season of my favorite slice of life anime. This season didn&rsquo;t have as much camping and food instead focusing on preparation, character development, and day to day life in general. While I am partial to the mindless comfiness of Season 1, I think Season 2 was objectively a bit better in that it expanded on the character relationships and was more meaningful in general. The episode 4 mini-skit where Nadeshiko gives her sister a hand warmer gift was so touching.</p>

<p>Attention to detail was great as well. I appreciate all the little things like the phone pictures changing in the intro, getting the squat-while-wearing-slippers animation right, etc.</p>

<p>Most of all though, I just enjoyed seeing 13 more episodes of Nadeshiko and gang.</p>

<p>I appreciate that this &ldquo;documentary&rdquo; brings important points to attention. Overfishing IS a huge problem. But I get the same vibes as The Social Dilemma. There&rsquo;s a clear animal rights agenda at play, and I can&rsquo;t help feeling that the narrator is misrepresenting the situation to look a lot worse than it actually is. Extreme claims and life-or-death thriller chases get the views, but how accurate are they? Pirate vigilantes are cool and all, but is that the solution we should be endorsing? The &ldquo;documentary&rdquo; suggests not eating any fish as the only solution, and that&rsquo;s completely un-realistic and a one-dimensional take on a complex issue. I also disliked Ali&rsquo;s passive aggressive/confrontational attitude. Like, if you forge a business card and sneak into a fishing conference, what do you think people will say when you ask them if they employ slave labor? Really?</p>

<p>So I guess props for the execution and bringing the issue to light. But a lot of issues with the actual content.</p>

<p>Big props to Joaquin Phoenix for absolutely nailing the character. Arthur Fleck&rsquo;s character was unnerving yet sympathy inducing. Pitiful at times, deplorable at others. The film really does make you stop and think about those who are dealt a bad hand. We see Arthur make an earnest attempt to dig himself out of his hole, to no avail.</p>

<p>Staircase symbolism was pretty neat, small victories occurring as he climbed up stairs and major defeats as he descended into madness. Also liked the parallels at the beginning and end: chasing after some kids and later running from the cops. In a way, it paints a picture of initial hope (chasing after a goal), eventually dashed (running away from his problems) as he gives up and embraces his anger towards unfair world.</p>

<p>I also appreciate the shaky camera work, giving the whole film a fittingly un-refined look. In general, everything in the film was fitting for Arthur&rsquo;s situation. The run-down apartment, garbage everywhere, and a drab color palette in general. I don&rsquo;t recall anything special about the sound production, which probably means it was good.</p>

<p>While I do appreciate the film, I can&rsquo;t say that I particularly liked it. It&rsquo;s not like Whiplash where I hated watching it but walked away saying &ldquo;damn, that was amazing.&rdquo; Yeah, some of the acting WAS amazing, but the whole vibe of the show and how it concluded doesn&rsquo;t really sit right with me. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been pretty lucky all my life, never experiencing pain to Arthur&rsquo;s extent. But surely the message here isn&rsquo;t to just give up and start murdering people. Really, I feel like the film didn&rsquo;t have a message. It was just a depressing showcase of an unlucky man. So in that way, it&rsquo;s not particularly memorable or enlightening.</p>

<p>Okay not gonna lie, I was bored out of my mind watching this. Only finished because it was a group watch party sort of thing. There&rsquo;s no plot or character development, absolutely nothing happens. There were a few okay episodes (e.g. gangster girl backstory), but there&rsquo;s no reason to watch this unlike you like pointless drama that doesn&rsquo;t go anywere. It&rsquo;s basically just contrived sob stories that aren&rsquo;t actually effective because of how shoehorned and bland the characters are.</p>

<p>Fun fact, the reason we don&rsquo;t have beefburgers and instead have HAMburgers is because they were invented in Hamburg, Germany.</p>

<p>Porco Rosso was a fun, goofy Ghibli film. It was a bit racist/sexist at times, but I guess the film was made 30 years ago so I&rsquo;ll give it a pass. Also still not entirely sure why the main character turned into a pig. But I loved the movie. The characters were charming and I loved how lighthearted the film was. The 5 year old hostages at the beginning of the movie were so cute.</p>

<p>Anthony Hopkins put on a great performance, worthy of his Oscar. I personally appreciated Olivia Colman&rsquo;s acting a bit more though. Her subtle sadness and despair was touching.</p>

<p>The Father was, for the most part, what I expected going in. A sad story detailing the downward spiral of an old man with dementia. It was heartbreaking, especially at the end when Hopkins just completely broke down like a baby. However, the movie didn&rsquo;t quite do it for me emotionally. I think it&rsquo;s because it was primarily from Anthony&rsquo;s POV. For the most part, it just felt confusing and deja-vu-ey to the audience, which is probably what it&rsquo;s really like to have dementia. But ignorance is bliss, and I feel like dementia&rsquo;s more painful for everyone else. Anne&rsquo;s helpless sadness was so agonizing to watch. On one hand, I wish we could&rsquo;ve seen more of her perspective. On the other, I get that the movie would be drastically worse if they tried it - we wouldn&rsquo;t get Anthony&rsquo;s inside look to really empathize with him.</p>

<p>Set design was spectacular. I love all the little touches they put in to differentiate scenes and to showcase the dementia at work. Pausing for a few minutes and comparing the side-to-side of the different-but-similar kitchen shots was fun. Also, just wanted to say, damn the people in this movie were well-dressed.</p>

<p>Man, writing this a day later, I still don&rsquo;t know how to feel about it. Objectively, it was pretty good. Good storytelling, directing, and Bong Joon Ho&rsquo;s classic (but well-appreciated) in-your-face presentation of themes. But the ending was just so dissatisfying&hellip; I get it. That&rsquo;s the point. Based on a true story where the killer was never found. It&rsquo;s a showcase of despair and hopelessness. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I went into the movie with a pre-conceived notion that it was a murder mystery and we&rsquo;d find the killer at the end. I just felt so empty after watching the movie. But it wasn&rsquo;t the same emptiness as Perfect Blue or Whiplash. Those films were gripping, tense, and immersive. This film, I just sort of watched from the safety of my room, wanting to know what would happen. Throughout, with each suspect, I could sort of just tell &ldquo;Yeah it&rsquo;s not him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, I want to commend the movie. It&rsquo;s objectively pretty good, it just didn&rsquo;t hit for me. And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>

<h3 id="violet-evergarden-violet-7-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353969/" target="_blank">Violet Evergarden</a>: 7 / 10</h3>

<p>First and foremost, Violet Evergarden is the most gorgeous anime I&rsquo;ve seen. It doesn&rsquo;t blow a money gun in your face the way Promare or Fate does. Rather, it&rsquo;s a subtle and consistent beauty. Pause the stream anytime and you have something screensaver worthy. The classical music and rich color scheme added to the refinement.</p>

<p>My next piece of major praise is some of the single-episode vignettes as Violet visits various people. While we don&rsquo;t have time to build a real relationship with these side characters, the complexity of the relationships and nuance of the emotions was brought out in a way I&rsquo;ve rarely seen before. The episode with the child/dying mother was beautifully done and really captured the confusion, conflict, and sadness you might expect in such a situation. Brought some tears to my eyes at the end, which rarely happens.</p>

<p>So given the animation quality and emotions some of the episodes brought forth, I&rsquo;ve gotta give the show some major props. That being said, I hated a lot of other aspects of the show. Violet Evergarden is a dull character. Her character growth is one-dimensional and flat. Her backstory doesn&rsquo;t actually make me feel sad, and I got annoyed at how much it got brought up. Yeah I get it, you had a traumatic past and you&rsquo;re emotionally stunted. I don&rsquo;t want to be told how to feel. I don&rsquo;t need flashbacks to the Major every 5 minutes.</p>

<p>I also felt that the non-vignette episodes fell flat. Like I said before, Violet&rsquo;s struggle with her past progresses in a boring and expected way. The ending also felt hugely contrived. Physics-defying action sequences, utterly stupid decision-making (wtf Violet, you&rsquo;re literally getting shot at, do something), and laughable plot-armor (Hey, we have these bayonets, let&rsquo;s try to stab her instead of shooting. And if we do shoot at point-blank, let&rsquo;s miss). Ruined my immersion and left a bad taste in my mouth to end the show.</p>

<p>Violet Evergarden has its ups and downs. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s rather average most of the way through, but when it does elevate, it brings it to 100%.</p>

<p>Niemann and Fletcher&rsquo;s relationship was just as captivating my second time watching. While a bit un-realistic at times, the story-telling was stellar. This time around, I watched with a group of people including a former jazz saxophonist. He provided a lot of context for the movie, and how the abusive and seemingly-unrealistic culture displayed was actually very reminiscent of Jazz&rsquo; early days. That in turn opened the movie up to additional interpretations (e.g. some people actually believe in Fletcher&rsquo;s style of invoking great musicians). A+ movie.</p>

<p>Book 1 was finished back in 2020. I loved it and gave it 9 / 10.</p>

<p><strong>Book 2: 9 / 10</strong>
Book 2 was probably my favorite third of the novel. Herbert&rsquo;s world-building is truly wonderful. The amount of detail put into the world of Arrakis is insane, not to mention all the political machinations, Fremen cultural/linguistic intricacies, and lore. It&rsquo;s clearly a made-up fantasy world, yet everything, from the character interactions to the technology to the ecosystems, just feels so sensical.</p>

<p>The main characters aren&rsquo;t particularly interesting in-of-themselves (Paul and Jessica are OP/unrelatable, Vladimir/Feyd-Reutha are caricatures of evil, etc). However, the story-telling more than makes up for it. There&rsquo;s so much plot setup; it&rsquo;s clear some major shit is gonna go down. I guess the premonitions of the future also indicate that pretty clearly.</p>

<p><em>Book 2 Finished: 5/7/2021</em></p>

<p><strong>Book 3: 4 / 10</strong>
Book 3 was rather disappointing. The first problem was pace. While the first book took it&rsquo;s time setting the stage, and the second book building Arrakis, the third book rushed to get to Muad&rsquo;dib&rsquo;s assured victory against the world.</p>

<p>Maybe I could&rsquo;ve seen this coming, but my other problem was the plot progression. There&rsquo;s so much destiny happening that it&rsquo;s rather clear how the story will progress. At this point, reading was somewhat of a formality to get to the end. Herbert&rsquo;s writing style remained captivating, especially during tense moments like the Feyd-Rautha kanly. However, the actual plot points and dialogue weren&rsquo;t particularly moving, which made for a boring end to an otherwise great novel.</p>

<p>For some reason, movie 3 made more sense to me than movie 2. I think it&rsquo;s because I half turned my brain off and didn&rsquo;t think too deeply about it. Character motivations were explored more than before (sadistic priest is back!), which was cool. But you could tell how rushed it was. There really should&rsquo;ve been another movie to space things out. My emotional reactions to the movie were mostly laughter (some scenes were sort of ridiculous) and awe at the animation. Never really developed any connection to the characters, so I didn&rsquo;t feel too bad when people died or good when people succeeded.</p>

<p>In terms of production quality, these Fate movies have unarguably the best animation I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Violet Evergarden is pretty, but Heaven&rsquo;s Feel is on another level. Pause almost anywhere and you have a breathtaking ultra-HD screensaver. And it&rsquo;s not just visuals - the OST, sound effects, and voice acting were all superb. The crown jewel of the movie was the Rider vs Saber fight. Watching it on the big screen, I had chills and almost wanted to cry. It was so beautiful. It&rsquo;s entirely possible I won&rsquo;t see a better anime fight scene in my life.</p>

The plot&rsquo;s completely random and disjointed. Character&rsquo;s have no depth or development. Oh yeah, and the animation looks like crap. Stylistic? No, just ugly CGI.

But I feel anxious writing this. There&rsquo;s too many suppressed memories that I need to relive for documentation purposes.</p>

<p>For one thing, there was that mini-speech that Keys gave about programming and how &ldquo;1s and 0s are more beautiful than words.&rdquo; Then there&rsquo;s the most in-your-face romance &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he liked me!&rdquo; sub-plot.

I especially liked the scene with the leaves. The scenery was beautiful, and the soundtrack was very fitting. Most of all, I appreciate the set/costume design.

That being said, the spider mountain arc was the most hyped up I&rsquo;ve been watching a show in a very long time. The end of episode 19 was straight up my favorite animation sequence of all time, it was so beautiful. By the end of the series, the main trio even grew on me. Yeah sure, they&rsquo;re all clowns, and maybe it&rsquo;s Stockholm syndrome, but I can appreciate the predictable brain-off humor. Really excited to see the movie and next season.

<p>I was not a fan of this movie. First of all, I wasn&rsquo;t scared at all. A bit creepy at the beginning, but it completely fails if it&rsquo;s supposed to be a horror movie. I read afterwards that the movie is supposed to be a metaphor for privilege and systemic oppression. Considering that&rsquo;s what Jordan Peele was going for, the movie made a lot of sense. But from a story-telling and entertainment perspective, it was a disaster. The film was not coherent at all. Things happened for no reason, the themes felt forced, and the reveal was entirely expected. I spent most of the movie confused rather than scared or entertained.</p>

<p>Burning was not my type of movie. It was definitely a slow burn. For a majority of the movie nothing happens. When things start to happen, we don&rsquo;t get concrete answers, and the movie ends without a satisfying resolution. I could appreciate the cinematography, but I was left extremely confused. Watching film analysis videos afterwards, I can see why critics would rate this movie highly. Subtle themes, clever storytelling, and makes you think. On one hand, I&rsquo;m not that smart, so a lot of that flew over my head. On the other hand, I guess I just appreciate films that are less ambiguous their message/plot. Also I did not like Jong-su.

<p>I think my expectations going into this movie were a bit too high. To me, everything - the story, the cinematography, and the characters - was just average. Fight scenes were pretty cool, but that&rsquo;s about it. I guess there were some cool themes (e.g. gender roles) and motifs (poison) that tied the movie together, but it still didn&rsquo;t feel very cohesive to me. The whole Lo desert backstory felt strangely out of place, and Jade Fox wasn&rsquo;t a satisfying villain. I also did not like Jia Long at all. She was super entitled the entire movie, and by the time she developed as a character, Mu Bai was dead and the movie was over. Oh well, onto the next wuxia film.</p>

<p>This movie is clearly half-way between a wuxia film and an American Marvel movie, and I was completely fine with that. Going in with low expectations, I actually really liked it. The Chinese/American mix was awkward at times, but I appreciated how relatable Awkwafina and Simu Liu&rsquo;s characters were. When Awkwafina was struggling to pronounce Shang-Chi and awkwardly not understanding Chinese, sure it was funny, but it felt good to see on the big screen. I guess it gives a bit more perspective of the people who push for diversity in casting.</p>

<p>That being said, I think Awkwafina was a bit out of place in the movie. She Marvel-fied the movie by tacking on pointless popcorn humor. But if the movie was presented more seriously, I think it really could&rsquo;ve been something special. It had cool wuxia fight sequences, Disney&rsquo;s budget, and some of the most amazing CGI I&rsquo;ve ever seen tacked onto an okay plot. Awkwafina popping up and cracking a joke sorta killed the &ldquo;this is awesome&rdquo; vibe.</p>

<p>But seriously, the CGI was amazing. The lighting and effects during fights featuring the 10 rings were extremely satisfying. And the CGI creatures in Ta Lo looked so real, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Not to mention the river dragon. Holy cow.</p>

<p>Honestly, the plot had quite a few holes as well as places where I just chose to shut my brain off. I very much disliked Awkwafina being relevant by being the only possible person who could shoot an arrow to save the day. But the overarching story was good; the writing could&rsquo;ve used just a bit more polishing.</p>

<p>But yeah. I liked the movie. Also, Tony Leung is a really good looking 60 year old, just saying.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed Squid Game. The ending was somewhat frustrating - come on man. Just spend the money. Give your daughter the gift you promised her. AND DON&rsquo;T GO BACK JESUS. I know you guys want another season, but ahh&hellip;</p>

<p>The show did a great job making an unlikely scenario realistic. Character actions and motives were reasonable, and I rarely thought to myself &ldquo;This is so dumb, why didn&rsquo;t X character do Y instead?&rdquo; The cast was fantastic and meshed well together. The banker played his scumbag at-all-costs role perfectly, and I loved all the side characters (RIP Ali, you deserved better). Yes, even that one annoying lady.</p>

<p>I really liked how the show jumped around and showed various sub-plots, all crucial to propelling the show forward. The organ harvesting sub-plot, for example, was not only entertaining and totally plausible, but added a lot to the show by tying together the cop, the players, and the game organizers.</p>

<h3 id="the-wire-season-1-wire-9-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire" target="_blank">The Wire Season 1</a>: 9 / 10</h3>

<p>I love The Wire. It might be the most realistic-feeling drama I&rsquo;ve seen. The premise is simple: investigators trying to bust drug dealers. But the execution is immaculate. We&rsquo;re shown everyones&rsquo; perspective, not just the investigative unit. And that elevates the experience. We get to see Bubbles scheme for $20, Idris Elba mastermind a drug operation, Omar hunt for targets, and Wallace struggle with his conscience. It&rsquo;s a showcase of Hood Baltimore and all the associated language, culture, and day to day struggles. Yes, there&rsquo;s a central plot and lots of action, but the show almost feels slice-of-life in that we&rsquo;re watching this mish-mash ofc complex characters living out their lives.</p>

<p>I gotta say, being an engineer is so cushy compared to a detective. I probably get paid 3 times as much to work half as hard.</p>

<p>I was too lazy to write up details while initially watching this. Some quick thoughts. I still love the way people talk in this show. Dialogue is funny, full of banter, and very &ldquo;hood.&rdquo; I love how the second season moved on to a new set of people while continuing the storylines for Season 1. All the new characters were full of life and made for a very entertaining viewing experience (yes, even Ziggy).</p>

<p>An excellent self-contained episode that lives up to the hype. It was well-paced, clever, and actually pretty spooky. I&rsquo;m very impressed and would watch more if not for my massive backlog of shows/movies as well as the sheer length of the series.</p>

<h3 id="the-vegetarian-vegetarian-5-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vegetarian" target="_blank">The Vegetarian</a>: 5 / 10</h3>

<p>The Vegetarian was one of those slow motion train wrecks that you can&rsquo;t look away from. I&rsquo;m not even sure if I liked the book, but at the very least it was interesting and a pretty quick read.</p>

<p>I think the book&rsquo;s main goal is to act as a character study for internal mental struggles and the world&rsquo;s general lack of empathy and communication. Me included. All three chapters are tied together by Yeong-hye, the main character of sorts, who slowly devolves from a quirky, yet functional member of society into a psych ward patient who refuses to eat anything because she thinks she&rsquo;s a tree.</p>

<p>The first chapter, which is from the perspective of her husband, sets the scene and is summarized by a lack of support for Yeong-hye. Rather, her husband and family are engrossed with the idea that she must eat meat, and that something is wrong with her. I&rsquo;d be frustrated too if I were her husband. But her father&rsquo;s force-feeding, and everyone&rsquo;s lack of empathy were very sad to read. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t entirely blame them though. Something really is wrong with Yeong-hye, and she acts in an entirely uncooperative way, refusing to elaborate or explain why, like a normal adult. It&rsquo;s fair to have your own reasons for something, but when everyone around you is trying to &ldquo;help&rdquo; and you don&rsquo;t offer anything other than &ldquo;I had a dream,&rdquo; it can be very frustrating to work with. Then again, we don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s going on in Yeong-hye&rsquo;s mind, and I guess that&rsquo;s part of the point.</p>

<p>The next chapter was from the perspective of her sister In-hye&rsquo;s husband. A coddled artist with a screw or two loose in his head. I was not a fan of this section. It was weird, but most of all, In-hye&rsquo;s husband just seemed like an asshole. We got to see his thought-process and his obsession first-hand, but I guess for me at least, his actions were predatory, wrong, and irredeemable. I think more than his actions, I was saddened by his lack of care for his family.</p>

<p>Finally, the last chapter focused on In-hye - a single-mother business owner who has to take on the burden of Yeong-hye&rsquo;s care. Leading up to this section, I felt bad for her, and even moreso reading it. Whereas she&rsquo;s sort of the perfect person on the outside in the previous sections, we find out that her sense of duty stems from childhood trauma and that she&rsquo;s barely holding everything together. Once again, it really shows you that people are going through shit that you don&rsquo;t realize. Her life just seems miserable, especially having to deal with her sister, who&rsquo;s a stick (mentally and physically) at this point.</p>

<p>Book ends without much of a conclusion other than feels bad. Make up my own inferences and whatnot. Sad.</p>

<p>Randomly watched this because some friends and I were bored, and I was actually super entertained by the series.</p>

<p>First of all, the casting was pretty perfect. the MC&rsquo;s constantly deadpan expression was super fitting, and the emotions shown by the supporting cast (e.g. Giho when he found out MC&rsquo;s real identity) felt so real. Mujin was a prett</p>

<p>The premise of an undercover gang member going undercover as a cop probably isn&rsquo;t anything new (e.g. The Departed), but it felt pretty novel to me, maybe it was the execution and all the deception involved.</p>

<p>The story itself was confusing at times - sure, everything checked out logically, but character motivations and actions&hellip; not so much. That being said, there was a LOT of plot jammed into 8 episodes, and it was thrilling to watch, from start to finish. Everything also tied together in a very satisfying way.</p>

<h3 id="dune-dunemovie-7-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/" target="_blank">Dune</a>: 7 / 10</h3>

<p>Writing this review a few days later, I barely remember the movie. It&rsquo;s very pretty and cinematic for sure. But otherwise, it&rsquo;s a forgettable and somewhat boring movie. The story stayed true to the book, and that&rsquo;s the problem - nothing happens. Sure there&rsquo;s political turmoil and scheming, but it&rsquo;s all just setup for the second half of the book (aka movie 2). We only see the real Arrakis - the Fremen Arrakis - in the last 20 minutes of the movie. At least movie two is confirmed, I guess.</p>

<p>That being said, I was very impressed by Dune&rsquo;s cinematography. The character casting felt almost perfect (other than Chalamet&rsquo;s unsophisticated American accent), and the CGI/set-building looked stunning. It&rsquo;s one of those movies where every other shot is a wallpaper. Only gripe really was that the soundtrack was overly repetitive and too dull for my tastes.</p>

<p>No real comments on the story - it followed the book and was excellent generally-speaking. I think the slow pacing definitely contributed to my boredom, although it was probably necessary to explain everything to someone unfamiliar with the source material.</p>

<h3 id="link-click-linkclick-5-10"><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/44074/Shiguang_Dailiren" target="_blank">Link Click</a>: 5 / 10</h3>

<p>Man, this show had so much potential. There were a few warning signs that the show wouldn&rsquo;t end in a satisfying way, but holy cow they botched it worse than I thought possible.</p>

<p>Before I start blasting Link Click, let me give it some praise. Animation looks clean and stylistic, OP/ED songs are great. Voice acting could use some work, but it was bearable. The premise of entering photographs for various purposes without actually changing the past is intriguing. The show is able to explore a lot of different scenarios, each pulling on your heartstrings in a different way. In that respect, the show is refreshing, especially with Chen Xiaoshi&rsquo;s impulsive/headstrong personality leading to interesting problems and solutions. I thoroughly enjoyed the individual missions, although things started to get messy once the overarching serial murder plot got tied in.</p>

<p>In terms of the bad, the show often introduced random twists and zingers just to evoke an emotional response. Xiaoshi&rsquo;s mom died in an earthquake - we forgot to mention it earlier, but since the current mission has to do with earthquake victims, let&rsquo;s add a tragic backstory. Other times, the random twists are to extend the story. All throughout the show, I sort of accepted Lu Guang and Chen Xiaoshi&rsquo;s abilities as unique (only they have it, for plot) and not really to be questioned (the mechanics don&rsquo;t make sense, just go with it). All of a sudden, in the last minutes of the last episode, we find out there&rsquo;s a third party treating murders as a game who has the ability to possess people. Qiao Ling stabs Lu Guang, Emma gets possessed-suicided, and everything gets un-done in preparation for season 2. There&rsquo;s zero foreshadowing for this, it just randomly gets introduced for the sake of season 2. Gah.</p>

<p>The show also tends to over-explain things, and that combined with the terrible twist endings is sort of just an insult to the viewer&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>

    </figure>



<p>Animation is up there with Spider-verse and Mob Psycho. Super pretty to look at, stylistic, and clean. The painted-over CGI was beautiful to watch. Soundtrack was great (and played super well into the fight scenes). Voice-acting was great. And all the attention to detail with the character design, world-building, motifs, etc. I could go on and on.</p>

<p>All the characters were excellent, especially Jinx. Her tragic backstory and subsequent schizophrenia combined for a very interesting character. A loose cannon who&rsquo;s unpredictable but in a coherent and sensible way. If anything, Jayce&rsquo;s character was a bit annoying and his character arc a bit cookie-cutter. Caitlyn too. But Viktor, Vander, Silco, and all the other side characters were excellent. My favorite character is definitely depressed hoodie Heimerdinger. Also shoutouts to Silco. I love a good, sympathetic villain.</p>

<p>Story was pretty standard but well executed. I think the way it was structured (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> backstory, <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> continuation) made for characters that felt more personal. It&rsquo;s like we watched everyone grow up.</p>

<p>The series built up to an explosive finale, culminating in a reset of sorts, and I&rsquo;m excited to see where things go next season.</p>
