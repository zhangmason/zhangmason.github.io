<p>Towards the end of 2018, I took a larger interest in films, largely thanks to a few friends who showed me the amount of thought, planning, and technology that goes into crafting a good movie. I figured I might as well document what I&rsquo;ve seen. My average rating as of June 25 is 7.13. I think that&rsquo;s reasonable, since I generally choose to watch good movies.</p>

<p>Phenomenal film - Probably the most suspenseful that I&rsquo;ve seen. Barring The Dark Knight, my favorite opening scene of all time. Christopher Waltz as Hans Landa is one of my favorite film villains ever.</p>

<p>Breathtaking nature documentary series narrated by David Attenborough. It takes what was good in the original series, and makes it even better. What else is there to say?</p>

<h4 id="jiro-dreams-of-sushi-jiro-8-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925/" target="_blank">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a>: 8 / 10</h4>

<p>Eye-opening documentary chronicling Jiro&rsquo;s journey as the foremost sushi chef in the world. I love hearing people talk about their passions, and Jiro really takes his art to the highest level. I may not like sushi, but I have nothing but respect for Jiro.</p>

<h4 id="shaun-of-the-dead-shaun-4-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/" target="_blank">Shaun of the Dead</a>: 4 / 10</h4>

<p>I can appreciate some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FOzD4Sfgag" target="_blank">unique directing</a>, but ultimately, this movie is a comedy, the point of which is to make you laugh. I personally didn&rsquo;t find the jokes/gags very funny.</p>

<h4 id="bird-box-birdbox-6-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2737304/" target="_blank">Bird Box</a>: 6 / 10</h4>

<p>I thought this was a better version of A Quiet Place. People bash on Bird Box for the plot holes, and it&rsquo;s bad anytime you have to question the premise of a movie, but it&rsquo;s still quite watchable and relatively enjoyable. All in all, a relatively average movie.</p>

<h4 id="django-unchained-django-8-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853728/" target="_blank">Django Unchained</a>: 8 / 10</h4>

<p>Pretty awesome movie, just watching Jamie Foxx kick some ass, Western style. This film was truly a Tarantino film, that&rsquo;s the best way to put it. Not particularly enlightening, but a very beautiful movie full of great dialogue, raw emotion, and lots of violence.</p>

<h4 id="room-room-2-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3170832/" target="_blank">Room</a>: 2 / 10</h4>

<p>I really didn&rsquo;t enjoy this movie. I feel like absolutely nothing happened. The characters weren&rsquo;t particularly likeable (and I know the kid didn&rsquo;t have the best environment growing up, but damn was he annoying), and there wasn&rsquo;t anything special about the plot or directing. I could&rsquo;ve read a 1 paragraph summary and taken away the same amount from the movie.</p>

<h4 id="spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-spiderverse-10-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/" target="_blank">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a>: 10 / 10</h4>

<p>Pretty cookie-cutter plot, but one of the most visually stunning films I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I really appreciate good animation, and the amount of style in Spiderverse is insanely impressive. And none of it ever felt overbearing or annoyingly unnecessary. It truly felt like I was watching a comic book. <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> based purely off of visuals, plot be damned.</p>

<p>Great cast of comedic support characters too.</p>

<p>A look into the life and work of Hayao Miyazaki. It gets a few points because, you know, Miyazaki. But overall, not a very good documentary. I don&rsquo;t think I took anything away from it other than learning that Miyazaki is reclusive. Very limited insight into the creative process for Ghibli movies.</p>

<p>Another lighthearted Ghibli movie. I didn&rsquo;t really take anything away from this movie, but it was a fun and iconic movie to pass the time.</p>

<h4 id="searching-searching-8-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7668870/" target="_blank">Searching</a>: 8 / 10</h4>

<p>I think that subversion of expectations (in a non-contrived way) adds a lot to enjoyment (all of my favorite meals were unexpected). In the case of Searching, I went in highly skeptical and was pleasantly surprised, skewing my rating upward slightly. Despite a very ordinary plot, the director did a great job presenting the film in a fresh way, that&rsquo;s relatable to millenials like me. It was also surprisingly touching, and the old-school Internet throwback at the beginning was fun.</p>

<h4 id="blackkklansmen-blackkklansmen-7-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7349662/" target="_blank">BlackkKlansmen</a>: 7 / 10</h4>

<p>A fun movie that presents a serious topic in a funny way. The plot doesn&rsquo;t really make much sense if you think about it (why not just have Flip also talk on the phone?). Also a bit heavy-handed towards the end, in my opinion.</p>

<h4 id="hereditary-hereditary-8-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7784604/" target="_blank">Hereditary</a>: 8 / 10</h4>

<p>This should be taken with a grain of salt, because I&rsquo;ve seen like 4 horror movies total, but this is the only horror movie that impressed me. Throughout the movie, there was a constant feeling of dread. Some of the scary moments, especially towards the end, were genuinely terrifying, and the acting was top-notch (especially from the mom). One thing that I don&rsquo;t like (and I think this is common to most horror movies) is the constant low-pitch buzzing and music. I get that it adds to the mood, but it just gives me a headache.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoiler </summary>
   Some of those final scenes legit gave me nightmares. Holy crap, the mom clinging to the ceiling and banging her head, what the hell?</p>

<p>One aspect that I appreciated was that the characters were all pretty rational and acted in relatable ways. None of that &ldquo;let&rsquo;s split up in this haunted mansion&rdquo; bullshit. Towards the end, the dad tried to call the police. What a smart cookie.</p>

<p>I think the bigger emphasis on supernatural elements in the last half of the movie could have been handled better, but it didn&rsquo;t really detract from the movie. The final scene was sort of weird though, not gonna lie.

<h4 id="black-swan-blackswan-9-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/" target="_blank">Black Swan</a>: 9 / 10</h4>

<p>I loved this movie. It&rsquo;s a very artistic movie, and it doesn&rsquo;t make any attempt to present that art subtly, but for an amateur movie-watcher like me, that&rsquo;s great as long as it&rsquo;s not overbearing. The black and white imagery went along great with Natalie Portman&rsquo;s transformation into the black swan.</p>

<p>Similar to the Prestige, the plot of the movie is layed out in the first few minutes of the film, so the story is rather straightforward, but in a good way. Rather than dealing with a convoluted plot, the audience knows exactly what it&rsquo;s getting, and can instead focus on Nina&rsquo;s journey and the presentation of that journey.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoilers </summary></p>

<p>the audience watching in horror as Nina spirals deeper and deeper out of control. When a movie sucks you in and makes you see &amp; feel what the characters feels, that&rsquo;s a good movie.</p>

<p>Apart from the color palette representing black swan vs white swan, purity vs passion, I think it also worked very well in setting the tone for Nina&rsquo;s psychological spiral. Black and white is depressing. There&rsquo;s a reason why I moved away from Minnesota (because of the depressing 6 month winter, not because I got a job in California). When you see the world in black and white, you lose perspective.</p>

<p>That being said, Black Swan also does a great job pulling you into Nina&rsquo;s character. The melting of reality and fantasy was displayed on screen, making the audience feel Nina&rsquo;s despair. When a movie does that, it&rsquo;s a good movie.</p>

<p>I also think the ending of the movie was perfect. The parallels between Nina and the artist she replaced, the figurative and literal transformation into the Black Swan, the red blood piercing the otherwise greyscale scene, and Nina&rsquo;s death all fit together to conclude the movie perfectly.</p>

<p></details></p>

<p>The music and ballet were top-notch. I also really like the cast of characters - the relentless director, the failed artist living vicariously through her daughter, and of course, the black and white swan, tragically intertwined.</p>

<h4 id="memento-memento-7-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/" target="_blank">Memento</a>: 7 / 10</h4>

<p>Memento is a very novel film. As you probably know, the story revolves around a man with short term memory loss who&rsquo;s trying to figure out who murdered his wife. The story is told in reverse chronological order, and as such, the audience essentially experiences what the main character experiences. It&rsquo;s definitely very impressive that this movie was even pulled off in the first place. It was definitely entertaining, but I didn&rsquo;t feel that much satisfaction watching it. Sure, it&rsquo;s a cool novelty, but there wasn&rsquo;t anything that really stood out to me other than a feeling of &ldquo;That&rsquo;s neat.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 id="green-book-greenbook-7-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6966692/" target="_blank">Green Book</a>: 7 / 10</h4>

<p>With how many Oscar nominations it got, I had to give it a go. It was a decent film in my opinion, but that&rsquo;s about it. Not really Best Picture worthy. It had some fun moments and some touching moments. But the plot was rather lackluster and unsurprising. A lot of the plot points felt like they happened for the sake of making a socially progressive movie. I feel like more could have been done with the movie.</p>

<p><strong>Watched:</strong> 2019-03-03</p>

<h4 id="no-country-for-old-men-nocountry-4-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/" target="_blank">No Country For Old Men</a>: 4 / 10</h4>

<p>I went into No Country For Old Men with high expectations, and came out rather disappointed. First and foremost, the movie was boring. There&rsquo;s only so much good themes and acting can do to make up for a boring movie, in my book. The movie features lots of silence (virtually no music) and boring dialogue. Looking online afterwards, people say the boring dialogue is part of what makes the movie so good, since it&rsquo;s realistic and real dialogue is boring. I think that&rsquo;s sort of bullshit. If I want that level of realism, I&rsquo;ll do stuff in real life or watch a documentary.</p>

<p>I also get that there were some interesting parallels between the characters, but every movie has those. What makes the character relations and themes in this movie any more special? The main villain of the movie is lauded as an amazing villain. I&rsquo;ll give it that he&rsquo;s pretty good - he has a cool weapon, interesting motives, and a completely unique mindset. A lot of the presentation surround him was pretty heavy-handed though:</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoiler </summary>
  A review I read online lauded the final scene (where he checks his shoes for blood before leaving the house) as a subtle nod towards his methodical nature and a perfect example of &ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo; However, I don&rsquo;t think there was anything subtle about it - it just felt sort of pretentious. That&rsquo;s a pretty blurred line between genius subtlety and pretentiousness though. And my opinion is probably related to me not enjoying the movie. Oh well.
</details></p>

<p>So the movie is supposed to be pretty deep, and it subverts a lot of expectations for a Hollywood movie. I don&rsquo;t know. It didn&rsquo;t really click for me.</p>

<h4 id="perfect-blue-perfectblue-10-10"><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/437/Perfect_Blue" target="_blank">Perfect Blue</a>: 10 / 10</h4>

<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know how I feel about this movie. On one hand, it was so good artistically. The transitions are creative, the use of motifs is excellent, and the way shots are presented immerse yourself into the main character&rsquo;s reality. I was fully pulled into Mima&rsquo;s point of view: unsure about reality.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, I knew that was the point of the movie going in. To experience an inability to distinguish between fact and fiction. But holy shit, Perfect Blue does it so well. There was a solid 30 minutes where I was sinking in my seat in horror, tensed with my hands to my face. I was legitimately terrified and confused. And I guess I could&rsquo;ve seen the ending coming, but I was so drawn in that, for me, it came out of nowhere and then it kept running. I don&rsquo;t know if Perfect Blue has any really meaningful message or if I&rsquo;d even say I enjoyed it that much, but damn is it good at what it does. Holy shit.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoilers </summary>
  Rarely am I blown away by a movie within the first half hour. Early on in Perfect Blue, a package bomb intended for Mima suddenly explodes, injuring her agent. Understandably, she&rsquo;s somewhat troubled by this. Later on, during an album celebration, someone pulls a party popper, making a similar loud noise. I flinched. Such a simple presentation made me understand PTSD so much more effectively than the literature I had previously read. And it really primed my fear, making the rest of the movie all the more terrifying.</p>

<p>I think the fact that this movie is presented through anime rather than live action also adds to the terror. Anime as a medium is inherently unrealistic. As such, it&rsquo;s that much harder to distinguish between Mima&rsquo;s reality and hallucinations. The unrealistic medium also lends itself better towards creative transitions that add to the immersion of the movie.</p>

<p></details></p>

<p>Who am I kidding, I loved this movie. Highly recommend to anyone 18 or older, but keep in mind this is NOT a family friendly movie. There&rsquo;s gore and sexual violence.</p>

<p>Also, Every Frame a Painting has a great video on Satoshi Kon that I really liked.</p>

<p>Really entertaining, albeit heavily dramatized, story about the creation of Facebook. Turns out most of it isn&rsquo;t true, but hey, it was entertaining, especially since a lot of the content (college, startups, Silicon Valley) are relevant to my life. Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg perfectly portrays a genius asshole. You hate him, but he&rsquo;s compelling enough such that you&rsquo;re interested in what he has to say. Facebook in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Finally got around to watching Princess Mononoke during a late night Keohane Atrium watch party. Pretty darn good. As expected of a Miyazaki film, the animation looks great and the character designs are splendid. What&rsquo;s a bit different from your average Ghibli film is that there&rsquo;s an actual plot to this movie. The movie is pretty heavy-handed with it&rsquo;s &ldquo;protect nature&rdquo; message, but I think it worked fine. My only gripe with the film is that Prince Ashitaka is essentially a walking plot device with no flaws or depth of character. Pretentious isn&rsquo;t quite the right word, but he&rsquo;s one of those characters that sort of emanates &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a better person than you&rdquo; with all his &ldquo;love not war&rdquo; rhetoric.</p>

  He also defends Princess Mononoke and eventually falls in love with her for no apparent reason.

<p>But apart from that, it was a great film with great storytelling despite all the different elements to it.</p>

<p>Honestly a pretty bad movie. People like it because it&rsquo;s a meme&hellip; right? Even so, it&rsquo;s one of those movies that&rsquo;s enjoyable to watch because it&rsquo;s so ridiculous. But the fight scenes weren&rsquo;t particularly good, and I can barely remember the actual story. Something about the Axe Gang.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I never watched Jackie Chan movies when I was a kid. I absolutely loved this movie. The fight scenes are actually so much better when the main actor actually knows how to fight. Who would&rsquo;ve thought? But for real, the way the shots were framed and presented enhanced the viewing experience so much. And knowing that Jackie Chan does his own stunts makes the whole experience feel so much cooler. The plot itself is pretty basic, but I don&rsquo;t want to be distracted by something as unimportant as plot anyway. All I care about is that Jackie Chan presents some of the coolest and funniest fight scenes I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The amount of talent, creativity, and hardwork that goes into making something like the final fight scene must be insane. Great movie. Highly recommend, even if you haven&rsquo;t seen Drunken Master I (I didn&rsquo;t beforehand, although I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s great). Drunken boxing is hilariously entertaining.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why this movie is so popular. Main character is weird in an unlikeable way, the pacing is bad, and the movie doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. I looked up explanations online afterwards, and the plot is incomprehensible unless you look it up. In terms of meaning, there are various theories floating around the internet, but my theory is that there is no deeper meaning. The director just put together a bunch of garbage, and the movie randomly got a cult following.</p>

<p>There it finally is. In my eyes, it&rsquo;s exactly what you expect out of the grand finale of the MCU. Nothing more, nothing less. A movie that serves solely to entertain and conclude the aftermath of Infinity War in an expected fashion. And it did that job very well.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoiler </summary>
  I think the only scene that I didn&rsquo;t like was the final battle against Thanos. It didn&rsquo;t feel quite as epic in scale as Infinity War. I was also mildly annoyed by the girl power sub-scene. If you want to make a statement about women being just as strong as their male counterparts, that&rsquo;s perfectly fine - but subtly interleave it into the rest of the movie instead of leaving it for a 1 minute scene at the end where you shove it in my face.
</details></p>

<p>But even though it was a great movie, I think that&rsquo;s it for me and Marvel (unless a really enticing standalone movie comes along). At this point, it&rsquo;s just too much effort to keep up with all the movies, plus the formula has become stale by this point.</p>

<p>An interesting cat-and-mouse film featuring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. It was entertaining watching DiCaprio&rsquo;s character execute his various lies/forgeries, and the ending was quite touching. The underlying themes about relationships and family were executed well. All in all, every aspect of the movie was pretty good. But nothing was really outstanding, and it wasn&rsquo;t particularly memorable or substantial.</p>

<p>A fun Ghibli coming-of-age story. As with a lot of Miyazaki films, the hand-drawn animations were superb and the tone pleasantly light-hearted. Not much in terms of plot, but that&rsquo;s okay. I go into the movie expecting something magical for my inner child, and nothing more.</p>

<p>Pretty mediocre story with the most mediocre of all plot twists. The two main character kids were also pretty annoying. Pretty much the only redeeming quality of this movie (basically the only reason why this film is watchable) is the existence of beautifully CGI&rsquo;ed Pokemon - a kid&rsquo;s dream come true. Movie is worth watching for that alone. Only thing missing was a Shuckle.</p>

<p>Very poetic movie with stunning audio and visuals. Some annoying moments (i.e. overly dramatic climax scene), immature main character (that&rsquo;s fine I guess, since he&rsquo;s supposed to be immature) and an unsatisfying ending (guess that&rsquo;s why people don&rsquo;t like Shinkai), but I respect that the movie represents a very realistic relationship.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Minor Spoilers </summary>
  The movie essentially fleshes out a meaningful relationship and then lets it gradually fade away. Sometimes, things just don&rsquo;t work out in life because of uncontrollable circumstances. If this movie were longer than 46 minutes, that sort of ending would likely be annoying (i.e. 5 cm/s), because everyone likes a happy ending. But I think it worked almost perfectly in this movie (again, minus the random emotional outbursts at the end).
</details></p>

<p>No real plot, but it&rsquo;s passable because that&rsquo;s not the point of the movie.</p>

<p>Basically what I expected. Straightforward story and humor with mediocre acting, but the inclusion of basketball legends like Michael Jordan. The combination of Looney Tunes and basketball players definitely gives it novelty and entertainment factor. But really there isn&rsquo;t anything to the movie beyond memes.</p>

<p>First and foremost, the animation was gorgeous. Animated films like Kimi No Na Wa look good, but a large part of that is stylistic. Pixar animation just blows that out of the water with photorealism and the power of technology. The grass, hair, rain, textures, lighting, character movement, camera movement, expressions, voice acting, and everything was amazing. Throughout the entire movie. The plethora of characters also meshed together surprisingly well. Sure, some of the OG toys were side-tracked for the sake of this new story, but that kept things fresh.</p>

<p>The movie was genuinely funny for all ages (Bunny and Ducky power fantasies, forky embracing being trash, etc), which is impressive. And finally, the plot was good. It was straightforward and lighthearted (which is expected of a kid&rsquo;s movie), but there was nuance to it for the adults to enjoy. I really liked the themes presented, especially Woody dealing with his identity crisis.</p>

   I was so happy at the end when he accepted that he needed to move on, and he decided to join up with Bo Peep (what a great romance) as a lost toy.

<p>Again, great movie. Highly recommend.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d rate it lower if not for the animation quality and beautiful setting/soundtrack. The animations are nice (other than some annoying shaky camera scenes), especially during the fight scenes, but otherwise, not as great of a movie as I would have expected from Bones. Pacing wasn&rsquo;t too great, with nothing much of substance happening for most of the movie (very little character development; all that really develops is a better understanding of what the heck is going on).</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoiler </summary>
   Once we finally understand what&rsquo;s going on, the movie abrupting transitions to a rescue the princess mission full of deus ex machina. The main antagonist was a pretty bad character (jerk whose only motivation is to find a worthy opponent) and the main plot premise was dumb. There was a little bit being said (especially in historical contexts) with the ronin trying to become lord and his speeches about ambition, but it wasn&rsquo;t really fleshed out. Same thing with the traitor monk - there was some potential there, but it wasn&rsquo;t really fleshed out.
</details></p>

<p>Overall, sort of disappointed. In the end, I didn&rsquo;t really take anything away from the movie.</p>
