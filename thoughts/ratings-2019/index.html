<p>Towards the end of 2018, I took a larger interest in films, largely thanks to a few friends who showed me the amount of thought and creativity that goes into a good movie. I figured I might as well document what I&rsquo;ve seen. Average movie rating for 2019 came out to 6.85. Makes sense. Watched a lot great stuff this year.</p>

<p>Probably the most suspenseful film that I&rsquo;ve seen. Pretty much perfect opening scene, and Christopher Waltz as Hans Landa is one of my favorite film villains ever.</p>

<p>Breathtaking nature documentary series narrated by David Attenborough. It takes what was good in the original series, and makes it even better. What else is there to say?</p>

<h3 id="jiro-dreams-of-sushi-jiro-8-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925/" target="_blank">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a>: 8 / 10</h3>

<p>Eye-opening documentary chronicling Jiro&rsquo;s journey as the foremost sushi chef in the world. I love hearing people talk about their passions, and Jiro really takes his art to the highest level. I may not like sushi, but I have nothing but respect for Jiro.</p>

<h3 id="shaun-of-the-dead-shaun-3-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/" target="_blank">Shaun of the Dead</a>: 3 / 10</h3>

<p>I can appreciate some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FOzD4Sfgag" target="_blank">unique directing</a>, but ultimately, this movie is a comedy, the point of which is to make you laugh. I personally didn&rsquo;t find the jokes/gags very funny.</p>

<h3 id="bird-box-birdbox-6-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2737304/" target="_blank">Bird Box</a>: 6 / 10</h3>

<p>I thought this was a better version of A Quiet Place. People bash on Bird Box for the plot holes, and it&rsquo;s bad anytime you have to question the premise of a movie, but it&rsquo;s still quite watchable and relatively enjoyable. All in all, a relatively average movie.</p>

<h3 id="django-unchained-django-8-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853728/" target="_blank">Django Unchained</a>: 8 / 10</h3>

<p>Pretty awesome movie, just watching Jamie Foxx kick some ass, Western style. This film was truly a Tarantino film, that&rsquo;s the best way to put it. Not particularly enlightening, but a very beautiful movie full of great dialogue, raw emotion, and lots of violence.</p>

<h3 id="room-room-2-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3170832/" target="_blank">Room</a>: 2 / 10</h3>

<p>I really didn&rsquo;t enjoy this movie. I feel like absolutely nothing happened. The characters weren&rsquo;t particularly likeable (and I know the kid didn&rsquo;t have the best environment growing up, but damn was he annoying), and there wasn&rsquo;t anything special about the plot or directing. I could&rsquo;ve read a 1 paragraph summary and taken away the same amount from the movie.</p>

<h3 id="spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-spiderverse-10-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/" target="_blank">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a>: 10 / 10</h3>

<p>Pretty cookie-cutter plot, but one of the most visually stunning films I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I really appreciate good animation, and the amount of style in Spiderverse is insanely impressive. And none of it ever felt overbearing or annoyingly unnecessary. It truly felt like I was watching a comic book. 10 / 10 based purely off of visuals, plot be damned.</p>

<p>Great cast of comedic support characters too.</p>

<p>A look into the life and work of Hayao Miyazaki. It gets a few points because, you know, Miyazaki. But overall, not a very good documentary. I don&rsquo;t think I took anything away from it other than learning that Miyazaki is reclusive. Very limited insight into the creative process for Ghibli movies.</p>

<p>Another lighthearted Ghibli movie. I didn&rsquo;t really take anything away from this movie, but it was a fun and iconic movie to pass the time.</p>

<h3 id="searching-searching-8-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7668870/" target="_blank">Searching</a>: 8 / 10</h3>

<p>I think that subversion of expectations (in a non-contrived way) adds a lot to enjoyment (all of my favorite meals were unexpected). In the case of Searching, I went in highly skeptical and was pleasantly surprised, skewing my rating upward slightly. Despite a very ordinary plot, the director did a great job presenting the film in a fresh way that&rsquo;s relatable to young folks like me. It was also surprisingly touching, and the old-school Internet throwback at the beginning was fun.</p>

<h3 id="blackkklansmen-blackkklansmen-7-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7349662/" target="_blank">BlackkKlansmen</a>: 7 / 10</h3>

<p>A fun movie that presents a serious topic in a funny way. The plot doesn&rsquo;t really make much sense if you think about it (why not just have Flip also talk on the phone?). Also a bit heavy-handed towards the end, in my opinion.</p>

<p><strong>Watched:</strong> 2019-02-02</p>

<h3 id="hereditary-hereditary-8-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7784604/" target="_blank">Hereditary</a>: 8 / 10</h3>

<p>This should be taken with a grain of salt, because I&rsquo;ve seen like 4 horror movies total, but this is the only horror movie that impressed me. Throughout the movie, there was a constant feeling of dread. Some of the scary moments, especially towards the end, were genuinely terrifying, and the acting was top-notch (especially from the mom). One thing that I don&rsquo;t like (and I think this is common to most horror movies) is the constant low-pitch buzzing and music. I get that it adds to the mood, but it just gives me a headache.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoiler </summary>
   Some of those final scenes legit gave me nightmares. Holy crap, the mom clinging to the ceiling and banging her head, what the hell?</p>

<p>One aspect that I appreciated was that the characters were all pretty rational and acted in relatable ways. None of that &ldquo;let&rsquo;s split up in this haunted mansion&rdquo; bullshit. Towards the end, the dad tried to call the police. What a smart cookie.</p>

<p>I think the bigger emphasis on supernatural elements in the last half of the movie could have been handled better, but it didn&rsquo;t really detract from the movie. The final scene was sort of weird though, not gonna lie.

<h3 id="black-swan-blackswan-9-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/" target="_blank">Black Swan</a>: 9 / 10</h3>

<p>I loved this movie. It&rsquo;s a very artistic movie, and it doesn&rsquo;t make any attempt to present that art subtly, but for an amateur movie-watcher like me, that&rsquo;s great as long as it&rsquo;s not overbearing. The black and white imagery went along great with Natalie Portman&rsquo;s transformation into the black swan.</p>

<p>Similar to the Prestige, the plot of the movie is layed out in the first few minutes of the film, so the story is rather straightforward, but in a good way. Rather than dealing with a convoluted plot, the audience knows exactly what it&rsquo;s getting, and can instead focus on Nina&rsquo;s journey and the presentation of that journey.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoilers </summary></p>

<p>the audience watching in horror as Nina spirals deeper and deeper out of control. When a movie sucks you in and makes you see &amp; feel what the characters feels, that&rsquo;s a good movie.</p>

<p>Apart from the color palette representing black swan vs white swan, purity vs passion, I think it also worked very well in setting the tone for Nina&rsquo;s psychological spiral. Black and white is depressing. There&rsquo;s a reason why I moved away from Minnesota (because of the depressing 6 month winter, not because I got a job in California). When you see the world in black and white, you lose perspective.</p>

<p>That being said, Black Swan also does a great job pulling you into Nina&rsquo;s character. The melting of reality and fantasy was displayed on screen, making the audience feel Nina&rsquo;s despair. When a movie does that, it&rsquo;s a good movie.</p>

<p>I also think the ending of the movie was perfect. The parallels between Nina and the artist she replaced, the figurative and literal transformation into the Black Swan, the red blood piercing the otherwise greyscale scene, and Nina&rsquo;s death all fit together to conclude the movie perfectly.</p>

<p></details></p>

<p>The music and ballet were top-notch. I also really like the cast of characters - the relentless director, the failed artist living vicariously through her daughter, and of course, the black and white swan, tragically intertwined.</p>

<h3 id="memento-memento-7-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/" target="_blank">Memento</a>: 7 / 10</h3>

<p>Memento is a very novel film. As you probably know, the story revolves around a man with short term memory loss who&rsquo;s trying to figure out who murdered his wife. The story is told in reverse chronological order, and as such, the audience essentially experiences what the main character experiences. It&rsquo;s definitely very impressive that this movie was even pulled off in the first place. It was definitely entertaining, but I didn&rsquo;t feel that much satisfaction watching it. Sure, it&rsquo;s a cool novelty, but there wasn&rsquo;t anything that really stood out to me other than a feeling of &ldquo;That&rsquo;s neat.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="green-book-greenbook-6-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6966692/" target="_blank">Green Book</a>: 6 / 10</h3>

<p>With how many Oscar nominations it got, I had to give it a go. It was a decent film in my opinion, but that&rsquo;s about it. Not really Best Picture worthy. It had some fun moments and some touching moments. But the plot was rather lackluster and unsurprising. A lot of the plot points felt like they happened for the sake of making a socially progressive movie. I feel like more could have been done with the movie.</p>

<p><strong>Watched:</strong> 2019-03-03</p>

<h3 id="no-country-for-old-men-nocountry-3-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/" target="_blank">No Country For Old Men</a>: 3 / 10</h3>

<p>I went into No Country For Old Men with high expectations, and came out rather disappointed. First and foremost, the movie was boring. There&rsquo;s only so much good themes and acting can do to make up for a boring movie, in my book. The movie features lots of silence (virtually no music) and boring dialogue. Looking online afterwards, people say the boring dialogue is part of what makes the movie so good, since it&rsquo;s realistic and real dialogue is boring. I think that&rsquo;s sort of bullshit. If I want that level of realism, I&rsquo;ll do stuff in real life or watch a documentary.</p>

<p>I also get that there were some interesting parallels between the characters, but every movie has those. What makes the character relations and themes in this movie any more special? The main villain of the movie is lauded as an amazing villain. I&rsquo;ll give it that he&rsquo;s pretty good - he has a cool weapon, interesting motives, and a completely unique mindset. A lot of the presentation surrounding him was pretty heavy-handed though.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoiler </summary>
  A review I read online lauded the final scene (where he checks his shoes for blood before leaving the house) as a subtle nod towards his methodical nature and a perfect example of &ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo; However, I don&rsquo;t think there was anything subtle about it - it just felt sort of pretentious. There&rsquo;s a pretty blurred line between genius subtlety and pretentiousness though. And my opinion is probably related to me not enjoying the movie. Oh well.
</details></p>

<p>So the movie is good because it&rsquo;s supposed to be pretty deep, and it subverts a lot of expectations for a Hollywood movie. I don&rsquo;t know. It didn&rsquo;t really click for me.</p>

<h3 id="perfect-blue-perfectblue-10-10"><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/437/Perfect_Blue" target="_blank">Perfect Blue</a>: 10 / 10</h3>

<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know how I feel about this movie. On one hand, it was so good artistically. The transitions are creative, the use of motifs is excellent, and the way shots are presented immerse yourself into the main character&rsquo;s reality. I was fully pulled into Mima&rsquo;s point of view: unsure about reality.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, I knew that was the point of the movie going in. To experience an inability to distinguish between fact and fiction. But holy shit, Perfect Blue does it so well. There was a solid 30 minutes where I was sinking in my seat in horror, tensed with my hands to my face. I was legitimately terrified and confused. And I guess I could&rsquo;ve seen the ending coming, but I was so drawn in that, for me, it came out of nowhere and then it kept running. I don&rsquo;t know if Perfect Blue has any really meaningful message or if I&rsquo;d even say I enjoyed it that much, but damn is it good at what it does. Holy shit.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoilers </summary>
  Rarely am I blown away by a movie within the first half hour. Early on in Perfect Blue, a package bomb intended for Mima suddenly explodes, injuring her agent. Understandably, she&rsquo;s somewhat troubled by this. Later on, during an album celebration, someone pulls a party popper, making a similar loud noise. I flinched. Such a simple presentation made me understand PTSD so much more effectively than the literature I had previously read. And it really primed my fear, making the rest of the movie all the more terrifying.</p>

<p>I think the fact that this movie is presented through anime rather than live action also adds to the terror. Anime as a medium is inherently unrealistic. As such, it&rsquo;s that much harder to distinguish between Mima&rsquo;s reality and hallucinations. The unrealistic medium also lends itself better towards creative transitions that add to the immersion of the movie.</p>

<p></details></p>

<p>Who am I kidding, I loved this movie. Highly recommend to anyone 18 or older, but keep in mind this is NOT a family friendly movie. There&rsquo;s gore and sexual violence.</p>

<p>Also, Every Frame a Painting has a great video on Satoshi Kon that I really liked.</p>

<p>Really entertaining, albeit heavily dramatized, story about the creation of Facebook. Turns out most of it isn&rsquo;t true, but hey, it was entertaining, especially since a lot of the content (college, startups, Silicon Valley) are relevant to my life. Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg perfectly portrays a genius asshole. You hate him, but he&rsquo;s compelling enough such that you&rsquo;re interested in what he has to say. Facebook in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Finally got around to watching Princess Mononoke during a late night Keohane Atrium watch party. Pretty darn good. As expected of a Miyazaki film, the animation looks great and the character designs are splendid. What&rsquo;s a bit different from your average Ghibli film is that there&rsquo;s an actual plot to this movie. The movie is pretty heavy-handed with it&rsquo;s &ldquo;protect nature&rdquo; message, but I think it worked fine. My only gripe with the film is that Prince Ashitaka is essentially a walking plot device with no flaws or depth of character. Pretentious isn&rsquo;t quite the right word, but he&rsquo;s one of those characters that sort of emanates &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a better person than you&rdquo; with all his &ldquo;love not war&rdquo; rhetoric.</p>

  He also defends Princess Mononoke and eventually falls in love with her for no apparent reason.

<p>But apart from that, it was a great film with great storytelling despite all the different elements to it.</p>

<p>Honestly a pretty bad movie. People like it because it&rsquo;s a meme&hellip; right? Even so, it&rsquo;s one of those movies that&rsquo;s enjoyable to watch because it&rsquo;s so ridiculous. But the fight scenes weren&rsquo;t particularly good, and I can barely remember the actual story. Something about the Axe Gang.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I never watched Jackie Chan movies when I was a kid. I absolutely loved this movie. The fight scenes are actually so much better when the main actor knows how to fight. Who would&rsquo;ve thought? But for real, the way the shots were framed and presented enhanced the viewing experience so much. And knowing that Jackie Chan does his own stunts makes the whole experience feel so much cooler. The plot itself is pretty basic, but I don&rsquo;t want to be distracted by something as unimportant as plot anyway. All I care about is that Jackie Chan presents some of the coolest and funniest fight scenes I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The amount of talent, creativity, and hardwork that goes into making something like the final fight scene must be insane. Great movie. Highly recommend, even if you haven&rsquo;t seen Drunken Master I (I didn&rsquo;t beforehand, although I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s great). Drunken boxing is hilariously entertaining.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why this movie is so popular. Main character is weird in an unlikeable way, the pacing is bad, and the movie doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. I looked up explanations online afterwards, and the plot is incomprehensible unless you look it up. In terms of meaning, there are various theories floating around the internet, but my theory is that there is no deeper meaning. The director just put together a bunch of garbage, and the movie randomly got a cult following.</p>

<p>There it finally is. In my eyes, it&rsquo;s exactly what you expect out of the grand finale of the MCU. Nothing more, nothing less (than a beautiful view). A movie that serves solely to entertain and conclude the aftermath of Infinity War in an expected fashion. And it did that job very well.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoiler </summary>
  I think the only scene that I didn&rsquo;t like was the final battle against Thanos. It didn&rsquo;t feel quite as epic in scale as Infinity War. I was also mildly annoyed by the girl power sub-scene. If you want to make a statement about women being just as strong as their male counterparts, that&rsquo;s perfectly fine - but please subtly interleave it into the rest of the movie instead of leaving it for a 1 minute scene at the end where you shove it in my face.
</details></p>

<p>But even though it was a great movie, I think that&rsquo;s it for me and Marvel (unless a really enticing standalone movie comes along). At this point, it&rsquo;s just too much effort to keep up with all the movies, plus the formula has become stale by this point.</p>

<p>An interesting cat-and-mouse film featuring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. It was entertaining watching DiCaprio&rsquo;s character execute his various lies/forgeries, and the ending was quite touching. The underlying themes about relationships and family were executed well. All in all, every aspect of the movie was pretty good. But nothing was really outstanding, and it wasn&rsquo;t particularly memorable or substantial.</p>

<p>A fun Ghibli coming-of-age story. As with a lot of Miyazaki films, the hand-drawn animations were superb and the tone pleasantly light-hearted. Not much in terms of plot, but that&rsquo;s okay. I go into the movie expecting something magical for my inner child, and nothing more.</p>

<p>Pretty mediocre story with the most mediocre of all plot twists. The two main character kids were also pretty annoying. Pretty much the only redeeming quality of this movie (basically the only reason why this film is watchable) is the existence of beautifully CGI&rsquo;ed Pokemon - a kid&rsquo;s dream come true. Movie is worth watching for that alone. Only thing missing was a Shuckle.</p>

<p>Very poetic movie with stunning audio and visuals. Some annoying moments (i.e. overly dramatic climax scene), immature main character (that&rsquo;s fine I guess, since he&rsquo;s supposed to be immature) and an unsatisfying ending (guess that&rsquo;s why people don&rsquo;t like Shinkai), but I respect that the movie represents a very realistic relationship.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Minor Spoilers </summary>
  The movie essentially fleshes out a meaningful relationship and then lets it gradually fade away. Sometimes, things just don&rsquo;t work out in life because of uncontrollable circumstances. If this movie were longer than 46 minutes, that sort of ending would likely be annoying (i.e. 5 cm/s), because everyone likes a happy ending. But I think it worked almost perfectly in this movie (minus the random overly emotional outbursts at the end).
</details></p>

<p>No real plot, but it&rsquo;s passable because that&rsquo;s not the point of the movie.</p>

<p>Basically what I expected. Straightforward story and humor with mediocre acting, but the inclusion of basketball legends like Michael Jordan. The combination of Looney Tunes and basketball players definitely gives it novelty and entertainment factor. But really there isn&rsquo;t anything to the movie beyond memes.</p>

<p>First and foremost, the animation was gorgeous. Animated films like Kimi No Na Wa look good, but a large part of that is stylistic. Pixar animation just blows that out of the water with photorealism and the power of technology. The grass, hair, rain, textures, lighting, character movement, camera movement, expressions, voice acting, and everything was amazing. Throughout the entire movie. The plethora of characters also meshed together surprisingly well. Sure, some of the OG toys were side-tracked for the sake of this new story, but that kept things fresh.</p>

<p>The movie was genuinely funny for all ages (Bunny and Ducky power fantasies, forky embracing being trash, etc), which is impressive. And finally, the plot was good. It was straightforward and lighthearted (which is expected of a kid&rsquo;s movie), but there was nuance to it for the adults to enjoy. I really liked the themes presented, especially Woody dealing with his identity crisis.</p>

   I was so happy at the end when Woody accepted that he needed to move on, and he decided to join up with Bo Peep as a lost toy. I guess I see a little bit of myself in him.

<p>I&rsquo;d rate it lower if not for the animation quality and beautiful setting/soundtrack. The animations are nice (other than some annoying shaky camera scenes), especially during the fight scenes, but otherwise, not as great of a movie as I would have expected from Bones. Pacing wasn&rsquo;t too great, with nothing much of substance happening for most of the movie (very little character development; all that really develops is a better understanding of what the heck is going on).</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoiler </summary>
   Once we finally understand what&rsquo;s going on, the movie abruptly transitions to a rescue the princess mission full of deus ex machina. The main antagonist was a pretty bad character (jerk whose only motivation is to find a worthy opponent) and the main plot premise was dumb. There was a little bit being said (especially in historical contexts) with the ronin trying to become lord and his speeches about ambition, but it wasn&rsquo;t really fleshed out. Same thing with the traitor monk - there was some potential there, but it wasn&rsquo;t expanded on.
</details></p>

<p>Overall, sort of disappointed. In the end, I didn&rsquo;t really take anything away from the movie.</p>

<p>Oh jeez. As a Minnesota native, You betcha I had to watch this movie. I realized at the end of the movie that this was directed by the Coen Brothers, and that explained a lot. I don&rsquo;t know. Something about how they direct just makes movies feel like they lack a plot even though they definitely do. I guess that&rsquo;s just their realistic style at work. After all, reality is boring and doesn&rsquo;t follow a script. While I can see the appeal of that in a movie, I just can&rsquo;t seem to be super entertained by it. All things considered, the story and pacing were pretty good, as was the acting. It was especially cool to see places I&rsquo;m very familiar with (e.g. the Xenia-Park Place sign on 394) in a high-profile movie. I think the light-hearted tone brought about by Marge and the over-exagerrated Minnesota accents made this much more enjoyable for me than No Country for Old Men. Darn tootin.</p>

<p>New Quentin Tarantino movie? Heck yeah. Overall, I&rsquo;d say it was enjoyable, but lacked direction. There were tons of great standalone scenes, full of stellar acting and funny moments. But honestly, the movie was just that - a collection of great scenes that didn&rsquo;t fit into a cohesive story. I guess that was part of the point - The scene selection, 60s music, and use of camera angles really made me feel like I was just hanging out and having a good time with everyone. But I still think the movie could have been organized better, especially with the jarring 3rd party narrations towards the end. Either way, Leonardo DiCaprio ironically played a washed up actor perfectly, and Brad Pitt was fun to have around. I get that Margot Robbie was supposed to be a foil to Leonardo, but she sort of just felt like eye candy and nothing more.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoilers </summary>
I was a big fan of the scene where Rick Dalton was talking with an 8 year old girl. It just felt so Tarantino - some ridiculous situation seeming perfectly natural. I thought it was hilarious. It was also an extended continuous shot, which meant Leonardo had to memorize a bunch of lines for it. Pretty ironic given the next scene.</p>

<p>The Bruce Lee scene was great. I died when he said &ldquo;My hands are registered lethal weapons.&rdquo; And then, while Bruce is dancing around, Cliff just chucks him at a car.</p>

<p>I also thought it was funny how most scenes had this slow, slow, mounting tension &mdash; and then nothing happened. Which made the ending so much more surprising. Like holy shit, those hippies got annihilated. I guess there was a point to the flamethrower after all.</p>

<h3 id="sinister-sinister-4-10"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1922777/" target="_blank">Sinister</a>: 4 / 10</h3>

<p>While I really enjoyed psychological horror movies like Perfect Blue and Black Swan, I have some gripes with the horror genre in general. I feel like there&rsquo;s often some supernatural element that makes everything feel contrived. Like, the setting is tied to reality so that the audience can relate to the horror felt by the main characters. But, then it&rsquo;s revealed that there&rsquo;s some random Pagan deity controlling everything, and I&rsquo;m just like &ldquo;?????&rdquo;. The immersion is lost on me. Also, when scary stuff happens, please just call the cops or something. I feel like more often that not, events unfold because characters aren&rsquo;t willing to take the obvious course of action. And I guess that&rsquo;s true for a lot of movies, but it just feels more infuriating when you, as the audience, know it&rsquo;s a horror movie and that main characters are going to die because of their poor decision making. There&rsquo;s no super heros or epic action protagonists. No one&rsquo;s gonna defy odds and survive. Nope. You&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>

<p>Anyways, in terms of Sinister, I liked a lot of the elements. The pacing was good, the main character had understandable motives and rationale for his actions, and it achieved its goal of being spooky. However, I think this movie definitely has a lot of the flaws I mention above. Movie was also relatively predictable. At least predictable is better than stuff happening completely at random.</p>

Also, dude c&rsquo;mon. Your wife is totally right about you putting your career over your family. Moving into a house where people were murdered, not telling your wife about that, ignoring problems with your kids&hellip; smh.</p>

<p>Also, I like how the main character was given a motive for not calling the cops - he makes bad decisions because he&rsquo;s desperate, not because he&rsquo;s stupid. Even so, when you see a video clip of yourself getting murdered and when random shit is happening in your house, maybe you should call the cops anyway.</p>

<p>Parasite definitely deserved all the hype it got. Anyone who&rsquo;s seen the movie knows that the plot&rsquo;s ridiculous and hilarious. But on top of that, it was a beautifully choreographed movie full of stunning visuals and superb cinematography. I can&rsquo;t say much without spoiling some aspect of the movie, so I&rsquo;ll just say go watch it if you haven&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoilers </summary>
Some scenes I really liked:</p>

<ul>
<li>The overhead scene where the dad left the murders&hellip; The weird camera angle, slow motion, and long shadows made everything feel surreal in a very fitting way.</li>
<li>The recurring shot of hanging socks by the window&hellip; A constant class reminder.</li>
<li>The son re-uniting with his dad in a dream. The off-center shot in the big empty shot felt really artsy.</li>
<li>The peach allergy scheme montage was super well choreographed and kept things fresh.</li>
<li>Cold reality at the very end was very fitting. The social commentary on class struggle was pretty heavy-handed, but I didn&rsquo;t mind it.</li>

<p>Holy shit what a movie. I&rsquo;m sitting on a plane at 3 AM, wide awake, in awe at how great that movie was.</p>

<p>This movie had some of the best acting I&rsquo;ve seen. Everyone was amazing (I really liked Wahlberg as Dignum - holy shit, he sold the verbal abuse), but Leonardo takes the cake. Who the hell won an Oscar over him? Again, that&rsquo;s the best acting I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The range and intensity of emotions, the subtleties of his motions and dialogue, everything. And is this where jack Nicholson cemented his crazy guy act? Because in the Shining, it sort of felt like a meme, but this was actually pretty scary.</p>

<p>I was completely absorbed into the story from the 45 minute mark onward. I think Perfect Blue is the only other movie that had me immersed like that. With the Departed, it was less so horror, and moreso pure entertainment and anticipation.</p>

<p><details>
  <summary> Spoilers </summary>
I&rsquo;m a sucker for happy endings. So I was a bit dissapointed that William had to put up with so much shit and still ended up dying. But I acknowledge the art and irony. A departure full of fanfare. Final scene with Dignum was pretty poetic (nice touch with the rat too).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be honest. I&rsquo;m writing this review a week later, and I can&rsquo;t really say I&rsquo;ve walked away with anything from the movie. I&rsquo;m sort of grasping at straws to remember what happened. So it definitely wasn&rsquo;t a memorable movie. It wasn&rsquo;t bad though. It was entertaining, and I think it was just about as good as it could have been given its inherently limited premise. Mixing comedy featuring Hitler with social commentary isn&rsquo;t exactly a recipe for success. The comedy worked on its own, but it was sporadic. And the lighthearted tone of the movie made the serious scenes less impactful. So inherently limited, but well-executed.</p>

<p>Overall a fun movie with decent soundtrack, artsy scenes/directing, and some quality satire.</p>
