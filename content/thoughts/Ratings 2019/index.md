## Intro

Towards the end of 2018, I took a larger interest in films, largely thanks to a few friends who showed me the amount of thought, planning, and technology that goes into crafting a good movie. I figured I might as well document my viewing history. 

Ratings are mostly based on personal enjoyment, but directing, creativity, and technical aspects are also factored in. My average film rating as of June 25 is 7.13. I think that's reasonable, since I generally choose to watch good movies.
