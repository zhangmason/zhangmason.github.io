Hi, I'm Mason. I'm currently working as an embedded systems engineer at [Ayar Labs](https://ayarlabs.com/). 

I made this website to write about personal projects and thoughts. Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn or social media if you have any comments or questions. I don't actually use the email linked on the front page; I just wanted to see if it would get scraped and spammed.
