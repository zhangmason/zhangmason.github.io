## Inspiration

I've been meaning to make a website for a while. In college, the thought process was to create a digital portfolio to showcase my worth. Now that I've graduated and have some time to kill before starting work, it's mostly just a fun project for self-improvement purposes. I figured that I could document all of my hobby projects and share some of my thoughts online rather than letting everything sit on my hard drive, for my eyes only.

Honestly, I'm not very interested in webdev. Rather than learning HTML/CSS/Javascript and all of the associated frameworks, I decided to use Hugo, a static site generator based on Golang. So, I set everything up, found [a theme that I liked](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/), and got a basic site up and running in just a few hours. 

I don't really have a specific timeline for this website. I just plan on posting whenever I work on something interesting, or feel like writing a blog post.
